    <h1><b>Christian Reader,</b></h1><br>
    The soul being so precious, and salvation so glorious—it is the highest 
    point of prudence to make preparations for the eternal world. It is beyond 
    all dispute, that there is an inheritance in light; and it is most 
    strenuously asserted in Holy Scripture that there must be a fitness and 
    suitability for it (Col. 1:12). If anyone asks, &quot;Who shall ascend into the 
    hill of the Lord?&quot; the answer is, &quot;He who has clean hands, and a pure heart&quot; 
    (Psalm 24:4). To describe such a person is the work of this ensuing 
    treatise. Here you have <i>the godly man's portrait</i>, and see him 
    portrayed in his full lineaments. </p>
    <p align="justify">What a rare thing godliness is! It is not airy and puffed 
    up—but solid, and such as will take up the heart and spirits. Godliness 
    consists in an exact harmony between holy <i>principles </i>and <i>practices</i>. 
    Oh, that all into whose hands this book shall providentially come, may be so 
    enamored with piety as to embrace it heartily. So sublime is godliness that 
    it cannot be delineated in its perfect radiance and luster, though an angel 
    should take the pencil. Godliness is our wisdom. &quot;The fear of the Lord, that 
    is wisdom&quot; (Job 28:28). Morality without piety is profound madness. 
    Godliness is a spiritual queen, and whoever marries her, is sure of a large 
    dowry with her. Godliness has the promise of the present life and of that 
    which is to come (1 Tim. 4:8). Godliness gives assurance, yes, holy triumph 
    in God; and how sweet is that! (Isaiah 32:17). </p>
    <p align="justify">It was old Latimer who said, &quot;When sometimes I sit alone, 
    and have a settled assurance of the state of my soul, and know that God is 
    my God—I can laugh at all troubles, and nothing can daunt me.&quot; Godliness 
    puts a man in heaven before his time. Christian, aspire after piety; it is a 
    lawful ambition. Look at the saints' characteristics here, and never leave 
    off until you have got them stamped upon your own soul. This is the grand 
    business which should swallow up your time and thoughts. Other speculations 
    and quaint notions are nothing, compared to the priceless soul. They are 
    like <i>wafers </i>which have fine words printed upon them, and are curious 
    to the eye—but are thin, and yield little nourishment. But I will not keep 
    you longer in the <i>porch</i>. Should I have enlarged upon any one 
    characteristic of the godly man, it would have required a volume—but 
    designing to go over many, I have contracted my sails, and given you only a 
    brief summary of things. If this piece conduces to the good of souls, I 
    shall have my desire. That the God of grace will effectually accomplish this 
    shall be the prayer of him who is<br>
    Yours in all Christian affection, <br>

    <font size="4">Introduction</font></p>
    </font></b></h1>
    <p align="justify">&quot;For this cause shall everyone who is godly pray unto 
    you.&quot; (Psalm 32:6)</p>
    <p align="justify">Holy David at the beginning of this psalm, shows us 
    wherein true happiness consists; not in beauty, honor, riches (the world's 
    trinity)—but in the forgiveness of sin. &quot;Blessed is he whose transgression 
    is forgiven&quot; (v. 1). The Hebrew word &quot;to forgive&quot; signifies &quot;to carry out of 
    sight&quot;, which agrees well with the words of Jeremiah: &quot;In those days, says 
    the Lord, the sins of Judah shall be sought for, and they shall not be 
    found&quot; (Jer. 50:20). This is an incomprehensible blessing, and such as lays 
    a foundation for all other mercies. I shall just glance at it, and lay down 
    these five assertions about it:</p>
    <font COLOR="#0000ff"><b>
    <p align="justify">1. Forgiveness of sin is an act of God's free grace.</p>
    </b></font>
    <p align="justify">The Greek word for &quot;forgive&quot; (<i>charizomai</i>) makes 
    clear the source of pardon. Pardon does not arise from anything inherent in 
    us—but is the pure result of free grace (<i>charis</i>). &quot;I, even I, am he 
    who blots out your transgressions for my own sake&quot; (Isaiah 43:25). When a 
    creditor forgives a debtor, he does it freely. Pardon of sin is a royal 
    thread, spun out of the heart of free grace. Paul cries out, &quot;I obtained 
    mercy&quot; (1 Tim. 1:13)—&quot;I was be-mercied&quot;. He who is pardoned, is all bestrewn 
    with mercy. When the Lord pardons a sinner, he does not only pay a debt—but 
    gives an inheritance!</p>
    <font COLOR="#0000ff"><b>
    <p align="justify">2. God, in forgiving sin, remits the guilt and penalty.
    </p>
    </b></font><i>
    <p align="justify">Guilt </i>cries for <i>justice</i>. No sooner had Adam 
    eaten the apple, than he saw the &quot;flaming sword&quot; and heard the curse. But in 
    forgiveness of sin, God indulges the sinner. He seems to say to him, &quot;Though 
    you have fallen into the hands of my justice and deserve to die—yet I will 
    absolve you, and whatever is charged against you shall be discharged.&quot;</p>
    <font COLOR="#0000ff"><b>
    <p align="justify">3. Forgiveness of sin is through the blood of Christ.</p>
    </b></font>
    <p align="justify">Free grace is the impulsive cause; Christ's blood is the 
    meritorious cause. &quot;Without shedding of blood is no remission of sin&quot; (Heb. 
    9:22). Justice would be revenged either on the <i>sinner, </i>or on the <i>
    surety</i>. Every pardon is the price of Christ's blood.</p>
    <font COLOR="#0000ff"><b>
    <p align="justify">4. Before sin is forgiven, it must be repented of.</p>
    </b></font>
    <p align="justify">Therefore repentance and remission are linked together: 
    &quot;that <i>repentance </i>and <i>forgiveness </i>of sins should be preached in 
    his name&quot; (Luke 24:47). Not that repentance in a popish sense <i>merits </i>
    forgiveness. Christ's blood must wash our tears away—but repentance is a 
    qualification, though not a cause of forgiveness. He who is humbled for sin, 
    will value pardoning mercy the more. When there is nothing in the soul but 
    clouds of sorrow, and now God brings a pardon—which is a setting up of a 
    rainbow in the cloud, to tell the sinner that the flood of wrath shall not 
    overflow him—oh, what joy there is at the sight of this rainbow! The soul 
    that before was steeped in tears, now melts in love to God (Luke 7:38, 47).</p>
    <font COLOR="#0000ff"><b>
    <p align="justify">5. God having forgiven sin, he will no longer call it to 
    remembrance. </b></font>(Jer. 31:34)</p>
    <p align="justify">The Lord will not upbraid us with former unkindness. &quot;He 
    will cast all our sins into the depths of the sea&quot; (Mic. 7:19). Sin shall 
    not be cast in like <i>cork </i>which rises up again—but like <i>lead </i>
    which sinks to the bottom. How we should all labor for this covenant 
    blessing!</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">(i) How sad it is to <i>lack </i>pardon! </b></font>It 
    must of necessity go badly with the malefactor, who lacks his pardon. All 
    the curses of God stand in full force against the unpardoned sinner; his 
    very <i>blessings </i>are cursed (Mal. 2:2). Caesar wondered at one of his 
    soldiers, who was so merry when he was in debt. Can that sinner be merry who 
    is heir to all God's curses—and does not know how soon he may take up his 
    lodgings among the damned!</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">(ii) How sweet it is to <i>have </i>pardon! </p>
    </b></font>
    <p align="justify">(a) The pardoned soul is out of the gunshot of hell 
    (Romans 8:33). Satan may accuse—but Christ will show a discharge! </p>
    <p align="justify">(b) The pardoned soul may go to God with boldness in 
    prayer. Guilt clips the wings of prayer, so that it cannot fly to the throne 
    of grace—but forgiveness breeds confidence. He who has his pardon, may look 
    his prince in the face with comfort.</p>
    <p align="justify">This great mercy of pardon David had obtained, as appears 
    in verse 5: &quot;You forgave me&quot;. And because he had found God &quot;a God of 
    pardons&quot; (Neh. 9:17), he therefore encouraged others to seek God in the 
    words of the text: &quot;For this cause shall everyone who is godly pray unto 
    you.&quot;</p>
    <h1><font COLOR="#ff0000"><b>
    <p align="justify"><br>
    <font size="4">The Nature of Godliness</font></p>
    </b></font></h1>
    <p align="justify">It will first be enquired, &quot;What is godliness?&quot; I answer 
    in general, &quot;Godliness is the sacred impression and workmanship of God in a 
    man, whereby from being carnal he is made spiritual.&quot; When godliness is 
    wrought in a person, he does not receive a new soul—but he has &quot;another 
    spirit&quot; (Numb. 14:24). The faculties are not new—but the qualities are; the 
    strings are the same—but the tune is corrected. Concerning godliness, I 
    shall lay down these seven maxims or propositions:</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">1. Godliness is a REAL thing</p>
    </b></font>
    <p align="justify">It is not a fantasy, but a fact. Godliness is not the 
    feverish fantasy of a sick brain; a Christian is no enthusiast, one whose 
    religion is all made up of theory. Godliness has truth for its foundation; 
    it is called &quot;the way of truth&quot; (Psalm 119:30). Godliness is a ray and beam 
    that shines from God. If God is true, then godliness is true.</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">2. Godliness is an INTRINSIC thing</p>
    </b></font>
    <p align="justify">It lies chiefly in the heart: &quot;circumcision is that of 
    the heart&quot; (Romans 2:29). The <i>dew </i>lies on the leaf, the <i>sap </i>is 
    hidden in the root. The <i>moralist's </i>religion is all in the leaf; it 
    consists only in externals—but godliness is a holy sap which is rooted in 
    the soul: &quot;Surely you desire truth in the inner parts; you teach me wisdom 
    in the inmost place&quot; (Psalm 51:6).</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">3. Godliness is a SUPERNATURAL thing</p>
    </b></font>
    <p align="justify">By nature we inherit nothing but evil. &quot;When we were in 
    the flesh, the motions of sins did work in our members&quot; (Romans 7:5). <i>We 
    sucked in sin as naturally as our mother's milk; </i>but godliness is the 
    &quot;wisdom from above&quot; (Jas. 3:17). It is breathed in from heaven. God must 
    light up the lamp of grace in the heart. <i>Weeds </i>grow by themselves; <i>
    flowers </i>are planted. Godliness is a celestial plant which comes from the 
    New Jerusalem. Therefore it is called a &quot;fruit of the Spirit&quot; (Gal. 5:22). A 
    man has no more power to make himself godly, than to create himself.</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">4. Godliness is an EXTENSIVE thing</p>
    </b></font>
    <p align="justify">It is a sacred leaven which spreads itself into the whole 
    soul: &quot;May the God of peace sanctify you wholly&quot; (1 Thess. 5:23). There is 
    light in the understanding, order in the affections, pliableness in the 
    will, exemplariness in the life. We do not call a black man white, because 
    he has white teeth. He who is good only in some part is not godly. Grace is 
    called &quot;the new <i>man</i>&quot; (Col. 3:10), not a new <i>eye</i>, or <i>tongue</i>—but 
    a new <i>man</i>. He who is godly is good all over; though he is regenerate 
    only in part—yet it is in every part.</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">5. Godliness is an INTENSE thing</p>
    </b></font>
    <p align="justify">It does not lie in a dead formality and indifference—but 
    is vigorous and flaming: &quot;fervent in spirit&quot; (Romans 12:11). We call water 
    hot when it is so in the third or fourth degree. He whose devotion is 
    inflamed is godly, and his heart boils over in holy affections.</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">6. Godliness is a GLORIOUS thing </p>
    </b></font>
    <p align="justify">As the jewel to the ring, so is piety to the soul, 
    bespangling it in God's eyes. Reason makes us men; godliness makes us 
    earthly angels; by it we &quot;partake of the divine nature&quot; (2 Pet. 1:4). 
    Godliness is near akin to glory: &quot;glory and virtue&quot; (2 Pet. 1:3). Godliness 
    is glory in the seed, and glory is godliness in the flower.</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">7. Godliness is a PERMANENT thing</p>
    </b></font>
    <p align="justify">Aristotle says, &quot;Names are given from the habit&quot;. We do 
    not call the one who blushes ruddy—but the one who is of a ruddy complexion 
    (1 Sam. 17:42). A blush of godliness is not enough to distinguish a 
    Christian—but godliness must be the temper and complexion of the soul. 
    Godliness is a fixed thing. There is a great deal of difference between a 
    stake in the hedge—and a tree in the garden. A stake rots and molders—but a 
    tree, having life in it, abides and flourishes. When godliness has taken 
    root in the soul, it abides to eternity: &quot;his seed remains in him&quot; (1 John 
    3:9). Godliness being engraved in the heart by the Holy Spirit, as with the 
    point of a diamond, can never be erased.</p>
    <h1><font COLOR="#ff0000"><b>
    <p align="justify"><br>
    <font size="4">A reproof to such as are only PRETENDERS to Godliness</font></p>
    </b></font></h1>
    <p align="justify">&quot;Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you 
    hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs, which look beautiful on the 
    outside but on the inside are full of dead men's bones and everything 
    unclean. In the same way, on the outside you appear to people as righteous 
    but on the inside you are full of hypocrisy and wickedness.&quot; Matthew 
    23:27-28 </p>
    <p align="justify">Here is a sharp rebuke to such as are &quot;glittering dross&quot; 
    Christians, who only make a show of godliness, like Michal, who put &quot;an 
    image in the bed&quot;, and so deceived Saul's messengers (1 Sam. 19:16). These 
    our Savior calls &quot;whited sepulchers&quot; (Matt. 23:27)—their beauty is all 
    paint! In ancient times a third part of the inhabitants of England were 
    called Picts, which signifies &quot;painted&quot;. It is to be feared that they still 
    retain their old name. How many are painted over with a religious 
    profession, whose seeming luster dazzles the eyes of beholders—but within 
    there is nothing but putrefaction! Hypocrites are like the swan, which has 
    white feathers—but a black skin; or like that flower, which has a lovely 
    appearance—but a bad scent. &quot;You have a name that you live, and are dead&quot; 
    (Rev. 3:1). These the apostle Jude compares to &quot;clouds without water&quot; (Jude 
    12). They claim to be full of the Spirit—but they are empty clouds; their 
    goodness is but a religious cheat.</p>
    <i>
    <p align="justify">Question:</i> But why do people content themselves with a 
    show of godliness?</p>
    <i>
    <p align="justify">Answer:</i> This helps to keep up their fame. Men are 
    ambitious of credit, and wish to gain repute in the world, therefore they 
    will dress themselves in the garb and mode of religion, so that others may 
    write them down for saints. But alas, what is one the better for having 
    others commend him—and his conscience condemn him? What good will it do a 
    man when he is in hell—that others think he has gone to heaven? Oh, beware 
    of this! Counterfeit piety is double iniquity.</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">1. To have only a show of godliness is a God-enraging sin</p>
    </b></font>
    <p align="justify">The man who is a pretender to saintship—but whose heart 
    tells him he has nothing but the name, carries Christ in his Bible but not 
    in his heart. Some political design spurs him on in the ways of God; he 
    makes religion a lackey to his carnal interest. What is this but to abuse 
    God to his face, and to serve the devil in Christ's livery? Hypocrisy makes 
    the fury rise up in God's face; therefore he calls such people &quot;the 
    generation of his wrath&quot; (Isaiah 10:6). God will send them to hell, to do 
    penance for their hypocrisy!</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">2. To make only a show of godliness is self-delusion</p>
    </b></font>
    <p align="justify">It is a horrible mistake to take <i>a show of grace, </i>
    for grace. This is to cheat yourself: &quot;deceiving your own souls&quot; (Jas. 
    1:22). He who has counterfeit gold instead of true gold, wrongs himself 
    most. The hypocrite deceives others while he lives—but deceives himself when 
    he dies.</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">3. To have only a name, and make a show of godliness, is 
    odious to God and man</p>
    </b></font>
    <p align="justify">The hypocrite is abhorred by all. Wicked men hate him 
    because he makes a show, and God hates him because he only makes a show. The 
    wicked hate him because he has so much as a mask of godliness, and God hates 
    him because he has no more. &quot;You have almost persuaded me to be a Christian&quot; 
    (Acts 26:28). The wicked hate the hypocrite because he is almost a 
    Christian, and God hates him because he is only almost one.</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">4. To make a show of piety is a vain thing </p>
    </b></font>
    <p align="justify">Hypocrites lose all they have done. Their sham tears drop
    <i>beside </i>God's bottle; their prayers and fasts prove abortive. &quot;When 
    you fasted and mourned, did you at all fast unto me, even to me?&quot; (Zech. 
    7:5). As God will not recompense a slothful servant, neither will he 
    recompense a treacherous one. The hypocrites' full reward is in this life: 
    &quot;They have their reward&quot; (Matt. 6:5). A poor reward—the empty breath of men. 
    The hypocrite may make his receipt and write, &quot;Received in full payment&quot;. 
    Hypocrites may have the praise of men—but though these triumphs are granted 
    them, they shall never have the privilege of sitting in heaven. What 
    acceptance can he look for from God, whose heart tells him he is no better 
    than a charlatan in divinity?</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">5. To have only a pretense of godliness will yield no 
    comfort at death</p>
    </b></font>
    <p align="justify">Will painted gold enrich a man? Will painted wine refresh 
    him who is thirsty? Will the paint of godliness stand you in any stead? How 
    were the foolish virgins better for their &quot;blazing lamps&quot;, when they had no 
    oil? What is the lamp of profession without the oil of grace? He who has 
    only a painted holiness shall have only a painted happiness.</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">6. You who have nothing but a specious pretext and mask 
    of piety expose yourself to Satan's scorn</p>
    </b></font>
    <p align="justify">You shall be brought forth at the last day, as was 
    Samson, to make the devil sport (Judges 16:25). He will say, &quot;What has 
    become of your vows, tears, confessions? Has all your religion come to this? 
    Did you so often defy the devil, and have you now come to dwell with me? 
    Could you meet with no weapon to kill you—but what was made of gospel metal? 
    Could you not suck poison anywhere but out of ordinances? Could you find no 
    way to hell—but by counterfeit godliness?&quot; What a vexation this will be, to 
    have the devil thus reproach a man! What will it be to have the devil 
    triumph over a man at the last day!</p>
    <p align="justify">Let us therefore take heed of this <i>pious pageantry </i>
    or <i>devout stage-play</i>. That which may make us fear our hearts the more 
    is when we see tall cedars in the church worm-eaten with hypocrisy. Balaam a 
    prophet, Jehu a king, Judas an apostle—all of them stand to this day on 
    record as hypocrites.</p>
    <p align="justify">It is true that there are the seeds of this sin in the 
    best Christian; but as it was with leprosy under the law, all who had 
    swellings or spots in the skin of the flesh were not reputed unclean and put 
    out of the camp (Lev. 13:6); so all who have the swellings of hypocrisy in 
    them are not to be judged hypocrites, for these may be the spots of God's 
    children (Deut. 32:5). But that which distinguishes a hypocrite is when 
    hypocrisy is predominant and is like a spreading cancer in the body.</p>
    <i>
    <p align="justify">Question: </i>When is a man under the dominion and power 
    of hypocrisy?</p>
    <i>
    <p align="justify">Answer:</i> There are two signs of its predominance: </p>
    <p align="justify">(i) When one serves God for sinister ends. </p>
    <p align="justify">(ii) When there is some sin dear to a man, which he 
    cannot part with. These two are as clear signs of a hypocrite as any I know.</p>
    <p align="justify">Oh, let us take David's candle and lantern, and search 
    for this leaven, and burn it before the Lord!</p>
    <p align="justify">Christian, if you mourn for hypocrisy—yet find this sin 
    so potent that you cannot get the mastery of it, go to Christ. Beg of him 
    that he would exercise his kingly office in your soul, that he would subdue 
    this sin, and put it under the yoke. Beg of Christ to exercise his spiritual 
    surgery upon you. Desire him to lance your heart and cut out the rotten 
    flesh, and that he would apply the medicine of his blood to heal you of your 
    hypocrisy. Say that prayer of David often: &quot;Let my heart be sound in your 
    statutes&quot; (Psalm 119:80). &quot;Lord, let me be anything rather than a 
    hypocrite.&quot; A <i>double-heart </i>will exclude from one heaven.</p>
	
	    <h1><font COLOR="#B07050" size="4"><b>
    <p align="center">The CHARACTERISTICS of a godly man<br>
&nbsp;</p>
    </b></font></h1>
    <p align="justify">It will be enquired in the next place, &quot;Who is the godly 
    man?&quot; For the full answer to this I shall lay down several specific signs 
    and characteristics of a godly man.</p>
    <h2><font COLOR="#ff0000"><b>
    <p align="justify"><br>
    1. A godly man is a man of KNOWLEDGE.</p>
    </b></font></h2>
    <p align="justify">&quot;The prudent are crowned with knowledge&quot; (Proverbs 
    14:18). The saints are called &quot;<i>wise </i>virgins&quot; (Matt. 25:4). A natural 
    man may have some head knowledge of God—but he &quot;knows nothing yet as he 
    ought to know&quot; (1 Cor. 8:2). He does not know God savingly. He may have the 
    eye of natural reason open—but he does not discern the things of God in a 
    spiritual manner. Waters cannot go beyond their spring-head. Vapors cannot 
    rise higher than the sun draws them. A natural man cannot act above his 
    sphere; he is no more able to judge sacred things aright than a blind man is 
    to judge colors. </p>
    <p align="justify">(i) He does not see the evil of his heart. If a face is 
    ever so black and deformed—yet it is not seen under a veil; the heart of a 
    sinner is so black that nothing but hell can pattern it—yet the veil of 
    ignorance hides it. </p>
    <p align="justify">(ii) He does not see the beauties of a Savior. Christ is 
    a pearl of great price—but a <i>hidden </i>pearl.</p>
    <p align="justify">But a godly man is taught by God: &quot;this anointing teaches 
    you of all things&quot; (1 John 2:27), that is, all things essential to 
    salvation. A godly man has &quot;the good knowledge of the Lord&quot; (2 Chron. 
    30:22). He has &quot;Sound wisdom&quot; (Proverbs 3:21). He knows God in Christ. To 
    know God <i>out </i>of Christ is to know him as an enemy—but to know him <i>
    in </i>Christ is sweet and delicious. A gracious soul has &quot;the savor of his 
    knowledge&quot; (2 Cor. 2:14). There is a great difference between one who has <i>
    read </i>of a country, or viewed it on the map—and another who has <i>lived
    </i>in the country, and tasted its fruits and spices. The knowledge with 
    which a godly man is adorned has these eight rare ingredients in it:</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">1. It is a GROUNDED knowledge</p>
    </b></font>
    <p align="justify">&quot;If you continue in the faith <i>grounded</i>&quot; (Col. 
    1:23). It is not simply believing <i>&quot;as my church believes.&quot;</i> Saving 
    knowledge rests upon a double basis: the Word and Spirit. The one is a 
    guide, the other a witness. Saving knowledge is not changeable or 
    doubtful—but has a certainty in it. &quot;We believe and are <i>sure </i>that you 
    are that Christ&quot; (John 6:69); &quot;being always confident&quot; (2 Cor. 5:6). A godly 
    man holds no more than he will die for. The martyrs were so confirmed in the 
    knowledge of the truth, that they would seal it with their blood.</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">2. It is an APPRECIATIVE knowledge</p>
    </b></font>
    <p align="justify">The jeweler who has the skill to value a jewel is said to 
    know it. He who esteems God above the comforts of the earth knows him (Psalm 
    73:25). To compare other things with God is to debase deity; as if you 
    should compare a <i>glow-worm </i>with the <i>sun</i>.</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">3. It is an ENLIVENING knowledge</p>
    </b></font>
    <p align="justify">&quot;I will never forget your precepts, for with them you 
    have <i>quickened </i>me&quot; (Psalm 119:93). Bible knowledge in a natural man's 
    head is like a torch in a dead man's hand. True knowledge animates. A godly 
    man is like John the Baptist, &quot;a <i>burning </i>and a <i>shining </i>lamp&quot;. 
    He not only <i>shines </i>by illumination—but he <i>burns </i>by affection. 
    The spouse's knowledge made her &quot;love-sick&quot; (Song 2:5). &quot;I am wounded with 
    love.&quot; I am like a deer that is struck with an arrow; my soul lies bleeding, 
    and nothing can cure me—but a sight of him whom my soul loves!</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">4. It is an APPLIED knowledge</p>
    </b></font>
    <p align="justify">&quot;I know that my redeemer lives&quot; (Job 19:25). A medicine 
    is best when it is <i>applied</i>. This applicative knowledge is joyful. 
    Christ is called a &quot;surety&quot; (Heb. 7:22). Oh what joy, when I am drowned in 
    debt, to know that Christ is my surety! Christ is called an &quot;advocate&quot; (1 
    John 2:1). The Greek word for advocate, <i>parakletos</i>, signifies a 
    comforter. Oh, what comfort it is when I have a bad cause, to know Christ is 
    my advocate, who never lost any cause he pleaded!</p>
    <i>
    <p align="justify">Question:</i> But how shall I know that I am making a 
    right application of Christ? A hypocrite may think he applies when he does 
    not. Balaam, though a sorcerer, still said, &quot;<i>my </i>God&quot; (Numb. 22:18).</p>
    <i>
    <p align="justify">Answer:</p>
    </i>
    <p align="justify">(i) He who rightly applies Christ puts these two 
    together, <i>Jesus </i>and <i>Lord</i>. &quot;Christ Jesus my <i>Lord</i>&quot; (Phil. 
    3:8). Many take Christ as <i>Jesus</i>—to save them; but refuse him as <i>
    Lord</i>—to rule them. Do you join &quot;<i>Prince </i>and <i>Savior</i>&quot; (Acts 
    5:31)? Would you as well be <i>ruled by Christ's laws </i>as <i>saved by his 
    blood? </i>Christ is &quot;a <i>priest </i>upon his <i>throne</i>&quot; (Zech. 6:13). 
    He will never be a priest to intercede—unless your heart is the throne where 
    he sways his scepter. A true applying of Christ is when we so take him as a 
    husband, that we give up ourselves to him as Lord.</p>
    <p align="justify">(ii) He who rightly applies Christ derives virtue from 
    him. The woman in the Gospel, having touched Christ, felt virtue coming from 
    him and her fountain of blood was dried up (Mark 5:29). This is to apply 
    Christ—when we feel a sin-mortifying virtue flow from him. That knowledge 
    which is applicatory, has an <i>antipathy against sin</i>, and will not 
    allow the heart to be dominated by sin.</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">5. It is a TRANSFORMING knowledge</p>
    </b></font>
    <p align="justify">&quot;We all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory 
    of the Lord, are <i>changed </i>into the same image&quot; (2 Cor. 3:18). As a 
    painter looking at a face draws a face like it in the picture; so looking at 
    Christ in the mirror of the gospel, we are changed into his likeness. We may 
    look at other objects that are beautiful—yet not be made beautiful by them. 
    A deformed face may look at beauty, and yet not be made beautiful. A wounded 
    man may look at a surgeon, and yet not be healed. But this is the excellence 
    of divine knowledge, that it gives us such a sight of Christ as makes us 
    partake of his nature! Like Moses when he had seen God's back parts, his 
    face shone; some of the rays and beams of God's glory fell on him.</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">6. It is a SELF-EMPTYING knowledge</p>
    </b></font>
    <p align="justify">Carnal knowledge makes the head giddy with pride (1 Cor. 
    8:1,2). True knowledge brings a man out of love with himself. The more he 
    knows—the more he blushes at his own ignorance. David, a bright star in 
    God's church, still thought himself rather a <i>cloud </i>than a <i>star </i>
    (Psalm 73:22).</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">7. It is a GROWING knowledge</p>
    </b></font>
    <p align="justify">&quot;<i>Increasing </i>in the knowledge of God&quot; (Col. 1:10). 
    True knowledge is like the light of the morning, which increases on the 
    horizon until it comes to the full meridian. So sweet is spiritual knowledge 
    that the more a saint knows—the more thirsty he is for knowledge. It is 
    called &quot;the riches of knowledge&quot; (1 Cor. 1:5). The more riches a man has, 
    the more still he desires. Though Paul knew Christ—yet he wanted to know him 
    more: &quot;That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection&quot; (Phil. 3:10).</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">8. It is a PRACTICAL knowledge</p>
    </b></font>
    <p align="justify">&quot;His sheep <i>follow </i>him because they know his 
    voice.&quot; (John 10:4). God requires a knowledge accompanied by obedience. True 
    knowledge not only improves a Christian's <i>sight</i>—but improves his <i>
    pace</i>. It is a reproach to a Christian to live in a contradiction to his 
    knowledge, to know he should be strict and holy—yet to live loosely. Not to
    <i>obey</i>—is the same as not to <i>know</i>: &quot;the sons of Eli knew not the 
    Lord&quot; (1 Sam. 2:12). They could not but know, for they taught others the 
    knowledge of the Lord; yet they are said not to <i>know</i>—because they did 
    not <i>obey</i>. When knowledge and practice appear together, then they 
    herald much happiness.</p>

    to be hasty and miss the way.&quot; (Proverbs 19:2). Ignorant people cannot give 
    God &quot;a <i>reasonable </i>service&quot; (Romans 12:1). It is sad that after the <i>
    Sun of righteousness </i>has shone so long in our hemisphere, people should 
    still be under the power of ignorance. Perhaps in the things of the world 
    they know enough, none shall outreach them—but in the things of God—they 
    have no knowledge. Nahash wanted to make a covenant with Israel, that he 
    might &quot;put out their right eyes&quot; (1 Sam. 11:2). Though men have knowledge in 
    secular matters; the devil has put out their right eye—they do not 
    understand the mystery of godliness. It may be said of them as of the Jews, 
    &quot;to this day the veil is upon their heart&quot; (2 Cor. 3:15). <b>Many Christians 
    are no better than baptized heathen! </b>What a shame it is to be without 
    knowledge! &quot;Some have not the knowledge of God; I speak this to your shame&quot; 
    (1 Cor. 15:34). Men think it a shame to be ignorant of their trade—but no 
    shame to be ignorant of God.<b> There is no going to heaven blindfold. </b>
    &quot;For this is a people without understanding; so their Maker has no 
    compassion on them, and their Creator shows them no favor.&quot; (Isaiah 27:11).</p>
    <p align="justify">Surely ignorance in these days is great. It is one thing 
    not to know, another thing not to be <i>willing </i>to know: &quot;men loved 
    darkness rather than light&quot; (John 3:19). It is the owl which loves the dark. 
    Sinners are like the Athlantes, a people in Ethiopia, who curse the sun. 
    Wicked men shut their eyes <i>willfully </i>(Matt. 13:15), and God shuts 
    them <i>judicially </i>(Isaiah 6:10).</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><i><b>
    <p align="justify">2. Are they godly, who, though they have knowledge—yet do 
    not know &quot;as they ought to know&quot;? </b></i></font>They do not know God 
    experimentally. How many knowledgeable people are ignorant? They have <i>
    illumination</i>—but not <i>sanctification</i>. Their knowledge has no 
    powerful influence upon them to make them better. If you set up a hundred 
    torches in a garden they will not make the flowers grow—but the sun is 
    influential. Many are so far from being better for their knowledge, that 
    they are worse: &quot;your knowledge has perverted you&quot; (Isaiah 47:10). The 
    knowledge of most people makes them more cunning in sin; these have little 
    cause to glory in their knowledge. Absalom might boast of the hair of his 
    head—but that hanged him; so these may boast of the knowledge of their 
    head—but it will destroy them!</p>

    not get into it!<b> Knowledge which is not personally applied, will only 
    light a man to hell! </b>It would be better to live a savage—than to die an 
    infidel under the gospel. <i>Christ not believed in </i>is dreadful. Moses' 
    rod, when it was in his hand, did a great deal of good. It wrought miracles; 
    but when it was out of his hand, it became a serpent. So Christ, when laid 
    hold on by the hand of faith, is full of comfort—but not laid hold on, will 
    prove a serpent to bite!</p>

    <p align="justify">Use 2: As we would prove ourselves to be godly, let us 
    labor for this good knowledge of the Lord. </b></font>What pains men will 
    take for the achievement of natural knowledge! Many spend years, searching 
    out the knowledge of an earthly trifle. What pains, then, should we take in 
    finding out the knowledge of God in Christ! There must be <i>digging </i>and
    <i>searching </i>for it, as one would search for a vein of silver: &quot;If you
    <i>look </i>for it as for silver and <i>search </i>for it as for hidden 
    treasure, then you will understand the fear of the Lord and find the 
    knowledge of God&quot; (Proverbs 2:4-5).</p>
    <p align="justify">This is the <b>best </b>knowledge. It as far surpasses 
    all other knowledge, as the diamond surpasses a stone. No jewel we wear so 
    adorns us as this: &quot;she is more precious than rubies&quot; (Proverbs 3:15). &quot;But 
    where can <i>wisdom </i>be found? Where does <i>understanding </i>dwell? Man 
    does not comprehend its worth. It cannot be bought with the finest gold, nor 
    can its price be weighed in silver. It cannot be bought with the gold of 
    Ophir, with precious onyx or sapphires. Neither gold nor crystal can compare 
    with it, nor can it be had for jewels of gold. The price of wisdom is beyond 
    rubies.&quot; (Job 28:12-18). The dark chaos was a fit emblem of an ignorant soul 
    (Gen. 1:2)—but when God lights up the lamp of knowledge in the mind, what a 
    new creation is there! Here the soul sparkles like the sun in its glory.</p>
    <p align="justify">This knowledge is <b>encouraging</b>. We may say of 
    worldly knowledge, as did Solomon, &quot;He who increases knowledge increases 
    sorrow&quot; (Eccles. 1:18). To know arts and science is to <i>gather straw</i>—but 
    to know God in Christ is to <i>gather pearl. </i>This knowledge ushers in 
    salvation (1 Tim. 2:4).</p>
    <font COLOR="#0000ff"><b>
    <p align="justify">Question: But how shall we get this saving knowledge?</p>
    </b></font><i>
    <p align="justify">Answer:</i> Not by the power of nature. Some speak of how 
    far <i>reason </i>will go if put to good use; but, alas! the plumb line of 
    reason is too short to fathom the deep things of God! A man can no more 
    reach the saving knowledge of God by the power of reason, than a pigmy can 
    reach the top of the pyramids. The light of nature will no more help us to 
    see Christ, than the light of a candle will help us to understand. &quot;The 
    natural man receives not the things of the Spirit of God: neither can he 
    know them&quot; (1 Cor. 2:14). </p>
    <p align="justify">What shall we do, then, to know God in a soul-saving 
    manner? I answer, let us implore the help of God's Spirit. Paul never saw 
    himself blind—until a light shone from heaven (Acts 9:3). God must anoint 
    our eyes before we can see! What need did Christ have to bid Laodicea to 
    come to him for eye salve, if she could see before (Rev. 3:18)? Oh, let us 
    beg the Spirit, who is &quot;the Spirit of revelation&quot; (Eph. 1:17). Saving 
    knowledge is not by <i>speculation</i>—but by <i>inspiration</i>, &quot;the 
    inspiration of the Almighty gives them understanding&quot; (Job 32:8).</p>
    <p align="justify">We may have excellent <i>notions </i>in divinity—but the 
    Holy Spirit must enable us to know them in a <i>spiritual </i>manner. A man 
    may see the figures on a sun-dial—but he cannot tell how the time, unless 
    the sun shines. We may read many truths in the Bible—but we cannot know them 
    savingly until God's Spirit shines upon us: &quot;the Spirit searches all things, 
    yes, the deep things of God&quot; (1 Cor. 2:10). The Scripture reveals Christ <i>
    to </i>us—but the Spirit reveals Christ in us (Gal. 1:16). The Spirit makes 
    known that which all the world cannot do, namely, the sense of God's love.</p>
    <font COLOR="#0000ff"><b>

    men are in the midnight of a natural state, the beauty of holiness is hidden 
    from them; but when the light of the Spirit comes in a saving manner, then 
    those truths which they slighted before, appear in that glorious luster, and 
    transport them with wonder and love.</p>
    <p align="justify">Bless God, you saints, that he has removed your <i>

    because you have hidden these things from the wise and prudent, and have 
    revealed them unto babes&quot; (Matt. 11:25). How you should admire free grace, 
    that God has not only brought the <i>light </i>to you—but given you <i>eyes
    </i>to see it; that he has enabled you to know the truth &quot;as it is in Jesus&quot; 
    (Eph. 4:21); that he has opened, not only the eye of your understanding—but 
    the eye of your conscience! It is a mercy you can never be thankful enough

    2. A godly man is a man moved by FAITH.</p>
    </b></font></h2>
    <p align="justify">As <i>gold </i>is the most precious among the metals, so 
    is <i>faith </i>among the graces. Faith cuts us off from the wild olive tree 
    of nature, and grafts us into Christ. Faith is the <i>vital artery of the 
    soul</i>: &quot;The just shall live by his faith&quot; (Hab. 2:4). Such as are 
    destitute of faith may breathe—but they lack spiritual life. </p>
    <i>
    <p align="justify">Faith enlivens all the <b>graces</b></i>; not a grace 
    stirs until faith sets it working. Faith is to the soul what the animal 
    spirits are to the body, exciting lively activity in it. Faith excites <b>
    repentance</b>. When I believe God's love to me, this makes me weep that I 
    should sin against so good a God. Faith is the mother of <b>hope</b>; first 
    we believe the promise, then we hope for it. Faith is the oil which feeds 
    the lamp of hope. Faith and hope are two turtledove graces; take away one, 
    and the other languishes. If the sinews are cut, the body is lame; if this 
    sinew of faith is cut, hope is lame. Faith is the ground of <b>patience</b>; 
    he who believes that God is his God, and that all providences work for his 
    good, patiently yields himself to the will of God. Thus faith is a living 
    principle.</p>
    <p align="justify">The <i>life </i>of a saint is nothing but a life of 
    faith. His <i>prayer </i>is the breathing of faith (Jas. 5:15). His <i>
    obedience </i>is the result of faith (Romans 16:26). A godly man lives by 
    faith in Christ, as the beam lives in the sun: &quot;I live; yet not I—but Christ 
    lives in me&quot; (Gal. 2:20). A Christian, by the power of faith, sees above 
    human reason, trades above the moon (2 Cor. 4:18). By faith his heart is 
    calmed and quieted; he trusts himself and all his affairs to God (Psalm 
    112:7). As in a time of war, men get into a garrison and trust themselves 
    and their treasures there, so &quot;the name of the Lord is a strong tower&quot; 
    (Proverbs 18:10), and a believer trusts all that he is worth in this 
    garrison. &quot;I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to 
    keep that which I have committed unto him against that day&quot; (2 Tim. 1:12). 
    God trusted Paul with his gospel, and Paul trusted God with his soul.</p>
    <p align="justify">Faith is a panacea—a remedy against all troubles. It is a 
    godly man's anchor which he casts out into the sea of God's mercy, and is 
    kept from sinking in despair. &quot;If only faith is firm, no ruin harms.&quot;</p>
    <i>
    <p align="justify">Use:</i> Let us test ourselves by this characteristic. 
    Alas, how far from being godly are those who are destitute of faith! Such 
    are altogether drowned in sense. Most men are spiritually blind; they can 
    only see just before them (2 Pet. 1:9). I have read of a people in India who 
    are born with one eye. Such are they who are born with the eye of <i>reason</i>—but 
    lack the eye of <i>faith</i>, who because they do not see God with bodily 
    eyes, do not believe in a God. They may as well not believe they have souls, 
    because they cannot be seen.</p>
    <p align="justify">Oh, where is he who lives in the heights, who has gone 
    into the upper region and sees &quot;things not seen&quot; (Heb. 11:27)? &quot;If men lived 
    by faith, would they use sinful means for a livelihood?&quot; (Chrysostom). If 
    there were faith, would there be so much fraud? If theirs were living faith, 
    would men, like dead fish, swim downstream? In this age there is scarcely so 
    much faith to be found among men, as there is among the devils, &quot;for they 
    believe and tremble&quot; (Jas. 2:19).</p>

    <p align="justify">&quot;I love the Lord, for he heard my voice; he heard my cry

    <p align="justify">Faith and love are the two hinges on which all religion 
    turns. A true saint is carried in that chariot, &quot;the midst whereof is paved 
    with love&quot; (Song 3:10). As faith enlivens, so love sweetens every duty. The 
    sun mellows the fruit, so love mellows the services of religion, and gives 
    them a better relish. A godly man is sick with love: &quot;Lord, you know that I 
    love you&quot; (John 21:16). &quot;Though, dear Savior, I denied you—yet it was for 
    lack of strength, not for lack of love.&quot; God is the fountain and 
    quintessence of goodness. His beauty and sweetness lay constraints of love 
    upon a gracious heart. God is the saint's portion (Psalm 119:57). And what 
    more loved than a portion? &quot;I would hate my own soul,&quot; says Augustine, &quot;if I 
    found it not loving God.&quot; A godly man loves God and therefore delights to be 
    in his presence; he loves God and therefore takes comfort in nothing without 
    him. 'Have you seen him whom my soul loves?&quot; (Song 3:3).</p>
    <p align="justify">The pious soul loves God and therefore thirsts for him. 
    The more he has of God, the more still he desires. A sip of the wine of the 
    Spirit whets the appetite for more. The soul loves God and therefore 
    rejoices to think &quot;of his appearing&quot; (2 Tim. 4:8). He loves him and 
    therefore longs to be with him. Christ was in Paul's heart, and Paul would 
    be in Christ's bosom (Phil. 1:23). When the soul is once like God, it would 
    gladly be with God. A gracious heart cries out, &quot;O that I had wings, that I 
    might fly away, and be with my love, Christ!&quot; The bird desires to be out of 
    the cage, though it is hung with pearl.</p>
    <p align="justify">Such is the love a gracious soul has to God, that many 
    waters cannot quench it. He loves a frowning God.</p>
    <p align="justify">A godly man loves God, though he is reduced to straits. A 
    mother and her nine-year-old child were about to die of hunger. The child 
    looked at its mother and said, &quot;Mother, do you think God will starve us?&quot; 
    &quot;No, child,&quot; said the mother, &quot;he will not.&quot; The child replied, &quot;But if he 
    does, we must love him, and serve him.&quot;</p>
    <font COLOR="#0000ff"><b>
    <p align="justify">Use:</b></font> Let us test our godliness by this 
    touchstone: Do we love God? Is he our treasure and center? Can we, with

    delight in drawing near to him, and &quot;come before his presence with singing&quot;?

    <i>court </i>him—but few <i>love </i>him. People are for the most part eaten 
    up with self-love; they love their ease, their worldly profit, their 
    lusts—but they do not have a drop of love to God. If they loved God, would 
    they be so willing to be rid of him? &quot;They say unto God, Depart from us&quot; 
    (Job 21:14). If they loved God, would they tear his name by their oaths? 
    Does he who shoots his father in the heart, love him? Though they worship 
    God, they do not love him; they are like the soldiers who bowed the knee to 
    Christ, and mocked him (Matt. 27:29). He whose heart is a grave in which the 
    love of God is buried, deserves to have that curse written upon his 
    tombstone, &quot;Let him be Anathema Maranatha&quot; (1 Cor. 16:22). A soul devoid of 
    divine love is a temper which best suits damned spirits. But I shall waive 
    this, and pass to the next.</p>

    4. A godly man is LIKE God.</p></h2>
    </b></font>
    <p align="justify">He has the same judgment as God; he thinks of things as 
    God does; he has a Godlike disposition; he &quot;partakes of the divine nature&quot; 
    (2 Pet. 1:4). A godly man bears both God's <i>name </i>and <i>image</i>; <i>
    godliness </i>is <i>Godlikeness</i>. It is one thing to <i>profess </i>God, 
    another thing to <i>resemble </i>him.</p>
    <p align="justify">A godly man is like God in holiness. Holiness is the most 
    brilliant pearl in the King of Heaven's crown: &quot;glorious in holiness&quot; (Exod. 
    15:11). God's power makes him mighty; his mercy makes him lovely; but his 
    holiness makes him glorious. The holiness of God is the intrinsic purity of 
    his nature and his abhorrence of sin. A godly man bears some kind of analogy 
    with God in this. He has the holy oil of consecration upon him: &quot;Aaron the
    <i>saint </i>of the Lord&quot; (Psalm 106:16). Holiness is the badge and mark of 
    Christ's people: &quot;The people of your holiness&quot; (Isaiah 63:18). The godly are 
    a <i>holy </i>as well as a <i>royal </i>priesthood (1 Pet. 2:9). Nor have 
    they only a frontispiece of holiness, like the Egyptian temples which were 
    fair outside—but they are like Solomon's temple, which had gold inside. They 
    have written upon their heart, &quot;Holiness to the Lord&quot;. The holiness of the 
    saints consists in their conformity to God's will, which is the rule and 
    pattern of all holiness.</p>
    <p align="justify">Holiness is a man's glory. Aaron put on garments &quot;for 
    glory and for beauty&quot; (Exod. 28:2). So when a person is invested with the 
    embroidered garment of holiness, it is for glory and beauty.</p>
    <p align="justify">The goodness of a Christian lies in his holiness, as the 
    goodness of the air lies in its clarity, the worth of gold in its purity.</p>
    <i>
    <p align="justify">Question</i>: In what do the godly reveal their holiness?</p>
    <i>
    <p align="justify">Answer:</p>
    </i>
    <p align="justify">1. <i>In hating &quot;the garment spotted by the flesh&quot;</i> 
    (Jude 23). The godly set themselves against evil, both in purpose and in 
    practice. They are fearful of that which looks like sin (1 Thess. 5:22). The 
    appearance of evil may harm a weak Christian. If it does not defile a man's 
    own conscience, it may offend his brother's conscience; and to sin against 
    him is to sin against Christ (1 Cor. 8:12). A godly man will not go as far 
    as he may, lest he go further than he should; he will not swallow all that 
    others may plead for.<i> It is easy to put a golden color on rotten 
    material.</p>
    </i>
    <p align="justify">2. <i>In being advocates for holiness.</i> &quot;I will speak 
    of your testimonies also before kings, and will not be ashamed&quot; (Psalm 
    119:46). When piety is calumniated in the world, the saints will stand up in 
    its defense; they will wipe off the dust of a reproach, from the face of 
    religion. Holiness defends the godly, and they will defend holiness; it 
    defends them from danger, and they will defend it from disgrace.</p>
    <font COLOR="#0000ff"><b>
    <p align="justify">Use 1:</b></font> How can those who are unlike God be 
    reputed to be godly? They have nothing of God in them, not one shred of 
    holiness. They call themselves Christians—but blot out the word holiness; 
    you may as well call it day at midnight.</p>
    <p align="justify">So impudent are some, that they boast they are none of 
    the holy ones. Is it not the Spirit of holiness which marks off the sheep of 
    Christ, from the goats? &quot;You were sealed (or marked) with the Holy Spirit&quot; 
    (Eph. 1:13). And is it a matter for men to boast of, that they have none of 
    the Spirit's earmark upon them? Does not the apostle say that &quot;without 
    holiness no man shall see the Lord&quot; (Heb. 12:14)? Such as bless themselves 
    in their <i>un</i>holiness had best go and ring the bells for joy, that they 
    shall never see God.</p>
    <p align="justify">There are others who hate holiness. Sin and holiness 
    never meet but they fight. Holiness discharges its fire of zeal against sin, 
    and sin spits its venom of malice at holiness. Many pretend to love Christ 
    as a Savior—but hate him as he is the Holy One (Acts 3:14).</p>
    <font COLOR="#0000ff"><b>
    <p align="justify">Use 2: </b></font>Let us strive to be like God in 
    holiness.</p>
    <p align="justify">1. <i>This is God's great design which he drives on in 
    the world</i>. It is the object of the Word preached. The silver drops of 
    the sanctuary are to water the seed of grace, and make a crop of holiness 
    spring up. What use is there in the promises, if not to bribe us to 
    holiness? What are all God's providential dispensations for—but to promote 
    holiness? As the Lord makes use of all the seasons of the year, frost and 
    heat, to produce the harvest, so all prosperous and adverse providences are 
    for the promoting of the work of holiness in the soul. What is the object of 
    the mission of the Spirit—but to make the heart holy? When the air is 
    unwholesome by reason of fog and mist, the wind is a fan to winnow and 
    purify the air. So the blowing of God's Spirit upon the heart is to purify 
    it, and make it holy.</p>
    <p align="justify">2. <i>Holiness is that alone, which God is delighted with</i>. 
    When Tamerlane was presented with a pot of gold, he asked whether the gold 
    had his father's stamp upon it. But when he saw it had the Roman stamp, he 
    rejected it. Holiness is God's stamp and impress; if he does not see this 
    stamp upon us, he will not own us.</p>
    <p align="justify">3. <i>Holiness fits us for communion with God</i>. 
    Communion with God is a paradox to the men of the world. Not everyone who 
    hangs about the court speaks with the king. We may approach God in duties, 
    and as it were hang about the court of heaven—yet not have communion with 
    God. That which keeps up fellowship with God, is holiness. The holy heart 
    enjoys much of God's presence; he feels heartwarming and heart-comforting 
    virtue in an ordinance. Where God sees his likeness, there he gives his 
    love.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
    <h2><font COLOR="#ff0000"><b>
    <p align="justify">5. A godly man is very exact and careful about the 
    WORSHIP of God.</p></h2>
    </b></font>
    <p align="justify">The Greek word for &quot;godly&quot; signifies a true worshiper of 
    God. A godly man reverences divine institutions—and is more for the <i>
    purity </i>of worship than the <i>pomp</i>. Mixture in sacred things is like 
    a dash in the wine, which though it gives it a color—yet only adulterates 
    it. The Lord wanted Moses to make the tabernacle &quot;according to the pattern 
    showed to you in the mount&quot; (Exod. 25:40). If Moses had left out anything in 
    the pattern, or added anything to it, it would have been very offensive to 
    God. The Lord has always given testimonies of his displeasure against such 
    as have corrupted his worship. Nadab and Abihu offered &quot;Strange fire&quot; 
    (different than what God had sanctified on the altar), &quot;and fire went out 
    from the Lord, and devoured them&quot; (Lev. 10:1,2). Whatever is not of God's 
    own appointment in his worship, he looks upon as &quot;Strange fire&quot;. And no 
    wonder he is so highly incensed at it, for it is as if God were not wise 
    enough to appoint the manner in which he will be served. Men will try to 
    direct him, and as if the rules for his worship were defective, they will 
    attempt to correct the copy, and superadd their inventions.</p>
    <p align="justify">A godly man dare not vary from the pattern which God has 
    shown him in the Scripture. This is probably not the least reason why David 
    was called &quot;a man after God's own heart&quot;, because he kept the springs of 
    God's worship pure, and in matters sacred did not add anything of his own 
    devising.</p>
    <font COLOR="#0000ff"><b>
    <p align="justify">Use:</b></font> By this characteristic we may test 
    ourselves, whether we are godly. Are we careful about the things of God? Do 
    we observe that mode of worship which has the stamp of divine authority upon 
    it? It has dangerous consequences to make a medley in religion.</p>
    <p align="justify">1. <i>Those who will add to one part of God's worship 
    will be as ready to take away from another</i>. &quot;Laying aside the 
    commandment of God, you hold the tradition of men&quot; (Mark 7:8). They who will 
    bring in a <i>tradition</i>, will in time lay aside a <i>command</i>. This 
    the Papists are very guilty of; they bring in altars and crucifixes, and lay 
    aside the second commandment. They bring in oil in baptism, and leave out 
    the cup in the Lord's Supper. They bring in praying for the dead, and lay 
    aside reading the Scriptures intelligibly to the living. Those who will 
    introduce into God's worship that which he has not commanded, will be as 
    ready to blot out that which he has commanded.</p>
    <p align="justify">2. <i>Those who are for outward mixtures in God's worship 
    usually disregard of the vitals of religion</i>—such as living by faith, 
    leading a strict mortified life; these things are of less concern to them.
    <i>Wasps </i>have their combs—but no honey in them.</p>
    <p align="justify">3. <i>Superstition and profanity kiss each other</i>. Has 
    it not been known that those who have kneeled at a pillar, have reeled in 
    drunkenness against a post?</p>
    <p align="justify">4. <i>Such as are devoted to superstition are seldom or 
    never converted:</i> &quot;publicans and harlots go into the kingdom of God 
    before you&quot; (Matt. 21:31). This was spoken to the chief priests, who were 
    great formalists, and the reason why such people are seldom wrought upon 
    savingly is because they have a secret antipathy to the power of godliness. 
    The serpent has a fine color—but it has a sting. So outwardly men may look 
    zealous and devout—but retain a sting of hatred in their hearts against 
    holiness. Hence it is that they who have been most hot on superstition have 
    been most hot on persecution. The Church of Rome wears white linen (an 
    emblem of innocence)—but the Spirit of God paints her out in scarlet (Rev. 
    17:4). Why is this? Not only because she puts on a scarlet robe—but because 
    she is of a scarlet dye, having imbrued her hands in the blood of the saints 
    (Rev. 17:6).</p>
    <p align="justify">Let us, then, as we would show ourselves to be godly, 
    keep close to the rule of worship, and in the things of Jehovah go no 
    further than we can say, &quot;It is written&quot;.</p>

    <p align="justify"><br>
    6. A godly man is a servant of God, not a servant of men.</p>
    </b></font></h2>
    <p align="justify">This characteristic has two distinct branches. I shall 
    speak of both in order.</p>
    <font COLOR="#0000ff"><b>
    <p align="justify">1. A godly man is a servant of God</p>
    </b></font>
    <p align="justify">&quot;We are the servants of the God of heaven&quot; (Ezra 5:11); &quot;Epaphras, 
    a servant of Christ&quot; (Col. 4:12).</p>
    <i>
    <p align="justify">Question:</i> In what sense is a godly man a servant of 
    God? </p>
    <i>
    <p align="justify">Answer: </i>In seven respects:</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">1. A servant leaves all others, and confines himself to 
    one master. </b></font>So a godly man leaves the service of sin, and betakes 
    himself to the service of God (Romans 6:22). Sin is a tyrannizing thing; a 
    sinner is a slave when he sins with most freedom. The wages which sin gives, 
    may deter us from its service: &quot;the wages of sin is death&quot; (Romans 6:23). 
    Here is damnable pay! A godly man enlists himself in God's family, and is 
    one of his menial servants: &quot;O Lord, truly I am your servant; I am your 
    servant&quot; (Psalm 116:16). David repeats himself, as if he had said, &quot;Lord, I 
    have given my pledge; no one else can lay claim to me; my ear is bored to 
    your service&quot;.</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">2. A servant is not independent, at his own disposal—but 
    at the disposal of his master.</b></font> A servant must not do what he 
    pleases—but be at the will of his master. Thus a godly man is God's servant. 
    He is wholly at God's disposal. He has no will of his own. &quot;May your will be 
    done on earth&quot;. Some will say to the godly, &quot;Why cannot you behave like 
    others? Why will you not drink and swear as others do?&quot; The godly are God's 
    servants; they must not do what they want—but be under the rules of the 
    family; they must do nothing but what they can show their master's authority 
    for.</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">3. A servant is bound. </b></font>There are agreements 
    and indentures sealed between him and his master. Thus there are indentures 
    drawn in baptism, and in conversion the indentures are renewed and sealed. 
    There we bind ourselves to God to be his sworn servants: &quot;I have sworn, and 
    I will perform it, that I will keep your righteous judgments&quot; (Psalm 
    119:106). A godly man has tied himself to the Lord by vow, and he makes 
    conscience of his vow. He would rather die by persecution than live by 
    perjury (Psalm 56:12).</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">4. A servant not only wears his master's uniform—but does 
    his work.</b></font> Thus a godly man works for God. Paul &quot;spent and was 
    spent for Christ&quot; (2 Cor. 12:15). He worked harder than all the other 
    apostles (1 Cor. 15:10). A godly man is active for God to his last breath, 
    &quot;even unto the end&quot; (Psalm 119:112). Only &quot;the dead rest from their labors&quot; 
    (Rev. 14:13).</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">5. A servant follows his master; thus a godly man is a 
    servant of God.</b></font> While others follow after the beast, he follows 
    after the Lamb (Rev. 13:3; 14:4). He wants to tread in the steps of Christ. 
    If a master leaps over hedge and ditch, the servant will follow him. A godly 
    man will follow Christ through afflictions: &quot;If any man will come after me, 
    let him take up his cross daily, and follow me&quot; (Luke 9:23). Peter wanted to 
    follow Christ on the water. A godly man will follow Christ though it is 
    death at every step. He will keep his goodness when others are bad. As all 
    the water in the salt sea cannot make the fish salty—but they still retain 
    their freshness; so all the wickedness in the world cannot make a godly man 
    wicked—but he still retains his piety. He will follow Christ in the worst 
    times.</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">6. A servant is satisfied with his master's allowance.</b></font> 
    He does not say, &quot;I will have such provisions made ready&quot;. If he has meager 
    fare, he does not find fault. He knows he is a servant, and accepts his 
    master's carving. In this sense, a godly man is God's servant; he is willing 
    to live on God's allowance; if he has only some leftovers, he does not 
    grumble. Paul knew he was a servant, therefore whether more or less fell to 
    his share, he was indifferent (Phil. 4:11). When Christians complain at 
    their condition, they forget that they are servants, and must live on the 
    allowance of their heavenly Master. You who have the least grace from God, 
    are debtors to his mercy.</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">7. A servant will stand up for the honor of his master.</b></font> 
    He cannot hear his master reproached—but will vindicate his credit. Thus, 
    every godly man will stand up for the honor of his Master, Christ. &quot;My zeal 
    has consumed me&quot; (Psalm 119:139). A servant of God stands up for his truths. 
    Some can hear God's name reproached, and his ways spoken against—yet remain 
    silent. God will be ashamed of such servants, and reject them before men and 
    angels.</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">Use: </b></font>Let us declare ourselves godly by being 
    servants of the most high God. Consider:</p>
    <b>
    <p align="justify">1. <i>God is the best Master</i>.</b> He is punctilious 
    in all his promises: &quot;There is no God like you, in heaven above, or on earth 
    beneath, who keeps covenant and mercy with your servants . . . not one word 
    of all his good promise has failed&quot; (1 Kings 8:23,56). God is of a most 
    sweet, gracious disposition. He has this quality that he is &quot;Slow to anger&quot; 
    and &quot;ready to forgive&quot; (Psalm 103:8; 86:5). In our needs, he relieves us; in 
    our weakness, he pities us. He reveals his secrets to his servants (Psalm 
    25:14; Proverbs 3:32). He waits on his servants. Was there ever such a 
    Master? &quot;It will be good for those servants whose master finds them watching 
    when he comes. I tell you the truth, he will dress himself to serve, will 
    have them recline at the table and will come and wait on them&quot; (Luke 12:37). 
    When we are sick, he makes our bed: &quot;you will make all his bed in his 
    sickness&quot; (Psalm 41:3). He holds our head when we are fainting. Other 
    masters may forget their servants, and cast them off when they are old—but 
    God will not: &quot;you are my servant: O Israel, you shall not be forgotten of 
    me&quot; (Isaiah 44:21). It is a slander to say that <i>God is a hard Master</i>.</p>
    <b>
    <p align="justify">2. <i>God's service is the best service</i>. </b>There 
    are six privileges in God's service:</p>
    <p align="justify">(i)<i> FREEDOM</i>. Though the saints are bound to God's 
    service—yet they serve him freely. God's Spirit, who is called a &quot;free 
    Spirit&quot; (Psalm 51:12), makes them free and cheerful in obedience. The Spirit 
    carries them on the wings of delight; he makes duty a privilege; he does not
    <i>force</i>—but <i>draw</i>. He enlarges the heart in love and fills it 
    with joy. God's service is perfect freedom.</p>
    <p align="justify">(ii)<i> HONOR</i>. David the king professed himself one 
    of God's pensioners: &quot;I am your servant&quot; (Psalm 143:12). Paul, when he wants 
    to blaze his coat of arms, and set forth his best heraldry, does not call 
    himself &quot;Paul, a Hebrew of the Hebrews&quot;, or &quot;Paul, of the tribe of 
    Benjamin&quot;—but &quot;Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ&quot; (Romans 1:1). Theodosius 
    thought it a greater dignity to be God's servant, than to be an emperor. 
    Christ himself, who is equal with his Father, is nevertheless not ashamed of 
    the title &quot;servant&quot; (Isaiah 53:11). Every servant of God is a son; every 
    subject is a prince! It is more honor to serve God than to have kings serve 
    us. The angels in heaven are servants of the saints on earth.</p>
    <p align="justify">(iii) <i>SAFETY</i>. God takes care of his servants. He 
    gives them protection: &quot;You are my servant; fear not; for I am with you&quot; 
    (Isaiah 41:9,10). God hides his servants: &quot;in the secret of his tabernacle 
    shall he hide me&quot; (Psalm 27:5). That is, he shall keep me safe, as in the 
    most holy place of the sanctuary, where none but the priests might enter. 
    Christ's wings are both for healing and for hiding, for curing and securing 
    us (Mal. 4:2). The devil and his instruments would soon devour the servants 
    of God, if he did not set an invisible guard about them, and cover them with 
    the golden feathers of his protection (Psalm 91:4). &quot;I am with you, and no 
    man shall set on you to hurt you&quot; (Acts 18:10). God's watchful eye is always 
    on his people, and the enemies shall not do the mischief they intend to do; 
    they shall not be destroyers—but physicians.</p>
    <p align="justify">(iv) <i>GAIN</i>. Atheists say, &quot;It is vain to serve God: 
    and what profit is it that we have kept his ordinances?&quot; (Mal. 3:14). 
    Besides the advantages which God gives in this life (sweet peace of 
    conscience), he reserves his best wine until last; he gives a glorious 
    kingdom to his servants (Heb. 12:28). The servants of God may for a while be 
    enslaved and abused—but they shall have promotion at last: &quot;where I am, 
    there shall also my servant be&quot; (John 12:26).</p>
    <p align="justify">(v) <i>ASSISTANCE</i>. Other masters cut out work for 
    their servants—but do not help them in their work. But our Master in heaven 
    gives us not only work—but strength: &quot;you strengthened me with strength in 
    my soul&quot; (Psalm 138:3). God bids us serve him, and he will <i>enable </i>us 
    to serve him: &quot;I will cause you to walk in my statutes&quot; (Ezek. 36:27). The 
    Lord not only fits <i>work </i>for us—but fits <i>us </i>for our work; with 
    his <i>command </i>he gives <i>enablement</i>.</p>
    <p align="justify">(vi) <i>SUPPLIES</i>. A master will not let his servants 
    be in need. God's servants shall be provided for: &quot;truly you shall be fed&quot; 
    (Psalm 37:3). Does God give us a <i>Christ</i>, and will he deny us a <i>
    crust</i>? &quot;The God who fed me all my life long&quot; (Gen. 48:15). If God does 
    not give us what we <i>crave</i>, he will give us what we <i>need</i>. The 
    wicked, who are dogs, are fed (Phil. 3:2). If a man feeds his <i>dog</i>, 
    surely he will feed his <i>child! </i>Oh, then, who would not be in love 
    with God's service?</p>
    <b>
    <p align="justify">3. <i>We are engaged to serve God</i>. </b>We are &quot;bought 
    with a price&quot; (1 Cor. 6:20). This is a metaphor taken from such as ransom 
    captives from prison by paying a sum of money for them. They are to be at 
    the service of those who ransomed them. So when the devil had taken us 
    prisoners, Christ ransomed us with a price, not of money—but of blood. 
    Therefore we are to be only at his service. If any can lay a better claim to 
    us than Christ, we may serve them; but Christ having the best right to us, 
    we are to cleave to him and enroll ourselves forever in his service.</p>

    <p align="justify">2. <i>There is a <b>religious </b>service we owe to men</i>, 
    when we are serviceable to their souls: &quot;your servants for Jesus' sake&quot; (2 
    Cor. 4:5).</p>
    <p align="justify">3. <i>There is a <b>sinful </b>serving of men</i>. This 
    consists of three things:</p>
    <p align="justify">(i) When we prefer men's injunctions before God's 
    institutions. God commands one thing; man commands another. God says, &quot;Sanctify the Sabbath&quot;; man says, &quot;Profane it.&quot; When <i>men's edicts </i>
    have more force with us than <i>God's precepts</i>, this is to be the 
    servants of men.</p>
    <p align="justify">(ii) When we voluntarily prostitute ourselves to the 
    impure lusts of men, we let them lord it over our consciences. When we are 
    pliable and conformable to any beliefs, either Arminian or atheist, for 
    either the gospel or the Koran. When we will be what others will have us be, 
    then we are just like Issachar, who is &quot;a strong donkey crouching down 
    between two burdens&quot; (Gen. 49:14). This is not <i>humility</i>—but <i>
    sordidness</i>, and it is men-serving.</p>
    <p align="justify">(iii) When we are advocates in a bad cause, pleading for 
    any impious, unjustifiable act; when we baptize sin with the name of 
    religion, and with our oratory wash the devil's face—this is to be the 
    servants of men. In these cases, a godly person will not so unman himself, 
    as to serve men. He says, like Paul, &quot;If I yet pleased men, I would not be 
    the servant of Christ&quot; (Gal. 1:10); and like Peter, &quot;We ought to obey God 
    rather than men&quot; (Acts 5:29).</p>
    <font COLOR="#0000ff"><b>
    <p align="justify">Use: </b></font>How many leagues distant from godliness, 
    are those who serve men, who either for fear of punishment, or from hope of 
    promotion, comply with the sinful commands of men, who will put their 
    conscience under any yoke, and sail with any wind which blows profit. These 
    are the &quot;Servants of men&quot;; they have abjured their baptismal vow, and 
    renounced the Lord who bought them.</p>
    <p align="justify">To the one who is so bendable as to change into any form, 
    and bow as low as hell to please men, I would say two things:</p>
    <p align="justify">1. You who have learned all your postures, who can cringe 
    and tack about—how will you look Christ in the face another day? When you 
    say on your death bed, &quot;Lord, look on your servant&quot;, Christ shall disclaim 
    you, and say, &quot;My servant? No! you renounced my service, you were &quot;a servant 
    of men&quot;; depart from me; I do not know you.&quot; What a cold shoulder this will 
    be at that day!</p>
    <p align="justify">2. What does a man get, by sinfully enslaving himself? He 
    gets a blot on his name, a curse on his estate, a hell in his conscience; 
    no, even those who he basely stoops to, will scorn and despise him. How the 
    high priests kicked off Judas! &quot;What do we care? That's your problem&quot; (Matt. 
    27:4).</p>
    <p align="justify">That we may not be the servants of men, let us abandon <i>
    fear </i>and advance <i>faith </i>(Esther 8:17). Faith is a world-conquering 
    grace (1 John 5:4). It overcomes the world's music and threats; it steels a 
    Christian with divine courage, and makes him stand immovable, like a rock in 
    the midst of the sea.</p>

    <p align="justify">To illustrate this, I shall show:</p>
    <p align="justify">A. That Jesus Christ is in himself precious.</p>
    <p align="justify">B. That a godly man esteems him precious.</p>

    </font></b>
    <p align="justify">&quot;Behold, I lay a stone in Zion, a chosen and <b>precious
    </b>cornerstone&quot; (1 Pet. 2:6).</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">1. Christ is compared to &quot;a bundle of myrrh&quot;</b></font> 
    (Song 1:13). Myrrh is very precious; it was one of the chief spices of which 
    the holy anointing oil was made (Exod. 30:25).</p>
    <p align="justify">(i) Myrrh is of a perfuming nature. So Christ perfumes 
    our persons and services, so that they are a sweet odor to God. Why is the 
    church, that heavenly bride, so perfumed with grace? Because Christ, that 
    myrrh tree, has dropped his perfume upon her (Song 3:6).</p>
    <p align="justify">(ii) Myrrh is of an exhilarating nature. Its fragrance 
    comforts and refreshes the spirits. So Christ comforts the souls of his 
    people, when they are fainting under their sins and suffering.</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">2. Christ is compared to a pearl:</b></font> &quot;when he had 
    found one pearl of great price&quot; (Matt. 13:46). Christ, this pearl, was 
    little with regard to his humility—but of infinite value. Jesus Christ is a 
    pearl that God wears in his bosom (John 1:18); a pearl whose luster drowns 
    the world's glory (Gal. 6:14); a pearl that enriches the soul, the angelic 
    part of man (1 Cor. 1:5); a pearl that enlightens heaven (Rev. 21:23); a 
    pearl so precious that it makes us precious to God (Eph. 1:6); a pearl that 
    is consoling and restorative (Luke 2:25). This pearl of more value than 
    heaven (Col. 1:16,17). </p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">3. The preciousness of Christ is seen in three ways:</p>
    </b></font><font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">(i) He is precious in his PERSON</b></font>; he is the 
    picture of his Father's glory (Heb. 1:3).</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">(ii) Christ is precious in his OFFICES</b></font>, which 
    are several rays of the Sun of righteousness:</p>
    <p align="justify">(a) Christ's PROPHETIC office is precious (Deut. 18:15). 
    He is the great oracle of heaven; he has a preciousness above all the 
    prophets who went before him; he teaches not only the <i>ear</i>—but the <i>
    heart!</i> He who has &quot;the key of David&quot; in his hand opened the heart of 
    Lydia (Acts 16:14).</p>
    <p align="justify">(b) Christ's PRIESTLY office is precious. This is the 
    solid basis of our comfort. &quot;Now once has he appeared to put away sin by the 
    sacrifice of himself&quot; (Heb. 9:26). By virtue of this sacrifice, the soul may 
    go to God with boldness: &quot;Lord, give me heaven; Christ has purchased it for 
    me; he hung upon the <i>cross</i>—that I might sit upon the <i>throne!&quot;</i> 
    Christ's <i>blood </i>(death) and <i>incense </i>(intercession), are the two 
    hinges on which our salvation turns.</p>
    <p align="justify">(c) Christ's REGAL office is precious: &quot;On his robe and 
    on his thigh he has this name written: KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS!&quot; 
    (Rev. 19:16). Christ has a pre-eminence above all other kings for majesty; 
    he has the highest throne, the richest crown, the largest dominions, and the 
    longest possession: &quot;Your throne, O God, is forever and ever&quot; (Heb. 1:8). 
    Though Christ has many assessors—those who sit with him (Eph. 2:6)—he has no 
    successors. Christ sets up his scepter where no other king does; he rules 
    the <i>will </i>and <i>affections</i>; his power binds the <i>conscience</i>. 
    The angels take the oath of allegiance to him (Heb. 1:6). Christ's kingship 
    is seen in two royal acts:</p>
    <b>
    <p align="justify">(1) In ruling his people.</b> He rules with mercy and 
    mildness; his regal rod has honey at the end of it. Christ displays the 
    ensign of mercy, which makes so many volunteers run to his rule (Psalm 
    110:3). Holiness without mercy, and justice without mercy, would be 
    dreadful—but mercy encourages poor sinners to trust in him.</p>
    <b>
    <p align="justify">(2) In overruling his enemies.</b> He pulls down their 
    pride, befools their policy, restrains their malice. That stone &quot;cut out of 
    the mountain without hands, which smote the image&quot; (Dan. 2:34) was an 
    emblem, says Augustine, of Christ's monarchical power, conquering and 
    triumphing over his enemies.</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">(iii) Christ is precious in his BENEFITS.</b></font> By 
    Christ all dangers are removed; through Christ all mercies are conveyed. In 
    his blood flows justification (Acts 13:39); sanctification (Heb. 9:14); 
    fructification (John 1:16); pacification (Romans 5:1); adoption (Gal. 4:5); 
    perseverance (Heb.12:2); glorification (Heb. 9:12). This will be a matter of 
    sublimest joy to eternity. We read that those who had passed over the sea of 
    glass stood with their harps and sang the song of Moses and the Lamb (Rev. 
    15:2,3). So when the saints of God have passed over the glassy sea of this 
    world, they shall sing hallelujahs to the Lamb who has redeemed them from 
    sin and hell, and has translated them into that glorious paradise, where 
    they shall see God forever and ever.</p>
    <b><font COLOR="#0000ff">
    <p align="justify"><br>
    B. A godly man esteems Christ as precious</p>
    </font></b>
    <p align="justify">&quot;Yes, he is very precious to you who believe!&quot; (1 Pet. 
    2:7). In the Greek it is &quot;an honor&quot;. Believers have an honorable esteem of 
    Christ. The psalmist speaks like one captivated with Christ's amazing 
    beauty: &quot;there is none upon earth that I desire beside you&quot; (Psalm 73:25). 
    He did not say he <i>had </i>nothing; he had many comforts on earth—but he
    <i>desired </i>none but God; as if a wife should say that there is no one's 
    company she prizes like her husband's. How did David prize Christ? &quot;You are 
    fairer than the children of men&quot; (Psalm 45:2). The spouse in the Song of 
    Solomon looked upon Christ as the the most incomparable one, &quot;the chief 
    among ten thousand&quot; (Song 5:10). Christ outvies all others: &quot;Like an apple 
    tree among the trees of the forest is my lover among the young men. I 
    delight to sit in his shade, and his fruit is sweet to my taste.&quot; (Song 
    2:3). Christ infinitely more excels all the beauties and glories of this 
    visible world than the apple tree surpasses the trees of the wild forest.</p>
    <p align="justify">Paul so prized Christ that he made him his chief study: 
    &quot;I determined not to know anything among you, save Jesus Christ&quot; (1 Cor. 
    2:2). He judged nothing else of value. He knew Christ best: &quot;have I not seen 
    Jesus Christ our Lord?&quot; (1 Cor. 9:1). He saw him with his bodily eyes in a 
    vision, when he was caught up into the third heaven (2 Cor. 12:2), and he 
    saw him with the eye of his faith in the blessed supper. Therefore he knew 
    him best. Consider how he slighted and despised other things in comparison 
    with Christ: &quot;I count all things but loss for the excellency of the 
    knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord&quot; (Phil. 3:8). Gain he esteemed loss, and 
    gold he esteemed dung, in comparison with Christ. Indeed, a godly person 
    cannot choose but set a high valuation upon Christ; he sees<b> a fullness of 
    value in him:</p>
    </b>
    <p align="justify">1. <i>A fullness in regard to variety</i>. &quot;In whom are 
    hidden all the treasures&quot; (Col. 2:3). No country has all commodities of its 
    own growth—but Christ has all kinds of fulness—fullness of merit, of spirit, 
    of love. He has a treasury adequate for all our needs.</p>
    <p align="justify">2. <i>A fullness in regard to degree</i>. Christ has not 
    only a few drops, or rays—but is more full of goodness than the sun is of 
    light; he has the fullness of the Godhead (Col. 2:9).</p>
    <p align="justify">3. <i>A fullness in regard to duration</i>. The fullness 
    in the creature, like the brooks of Arabia, is soon dried up—but Christ's 
    fullness is inexhaustible; it is a fullness overflowing and ever-flowing.</p>
    <p align="justify">And this fullness is for believers: Christ is a common 
    treasury or storehouse for the saints: &quot;of his fullness have all we 
    received&quot; (John 1:16). Put a glass under a <i>still </i>and it receives 
    water out of the still, drop by drop. So those who are united to Christ have 
    the dews and drops of his grace distilling on them. Well, then, may Christ 
    be admired by all those who believe.</p>
    <font COLOR="#0000ff"><b>
    <p align="justify">Use 1:</b></font> Is a godly man a high prizer of Christ? 
    Then what is to be thought of those who do not put a value upon Christ? Are 
    they godly or not? <b>There are four kinds of people who do not prize 
    Christ:</p>
    </b>
    <p align="justify">1. <i>The Jews</i>. They do not believe in Christ: &quot;unto 
    this day, the veil is upon their heart&quot; (2 Cor. 3:15). They expect their 
    future age and a Messiah still to come, as their own Talmud reports. They 
    blaspheme Christ; they slight <i>imputed </i>righteousness; they despise the 
    virgin Mary, calling her in derision <i>Marah</i>, which signifies 
    bitterness; they vilify the gospel; they hold Christians in abomination; 
    they regard it as not lawful for a Jew to take medicine from a Christian. 
    Schecardus relates the story of one, Bendema, a Jew who was bitten by a 
    snake. A Christian came to heal him—but he refused his help and chose rather 
    to die than to be healed by a Christian. So do the Jews hate Christ and all 
    that wear his uniform.</p>
    <p align="justify">2. <i>The Socinians</i>, who acknowledge deny Christ's 
    divinity. This is to set him below the angels, for human nature, simply 
    considered, is inferior to the angelic (Psalm 8:5).</p>
    <p align="justify">3. <i>Proud nominal Christians</i>, who do not lay the 
    whole stress of their salvation upon Christ—but would mingle <i>their dross
    </i>with <i>his gold</i>, <i>their duties </i>with <i>his merits</i>. This 
    is to steal a jewel from Christ's crown and implicitly to deny him to be a 
    perfect Savior.</p>
    <p align="justify">4. <i>Airy theorists</i>, who prefer the study of the 
    arts and sciences before Christ. Not that the knowledge of these is not 
    commendable: &quot;Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians&quot; (Acts 
    7:22). Human learning is of good use to prepare for the study of better 
    things, as a coarser dye prepares the cloth for a richer and a deeper dye. 
    But the fault is when the study of Christ is neglected. The knowledge of 
    Christ ought to have the preeminence. It was surely not without a mystery, 
    that God allowed all Solomon's writings about birds and plants to be 
    lost—but what he wrote about spiritual wisdom to be miraculously preserved, 
    as if God would teach us that to know Christ (the true Wisdom) is the 
    crowning knowledge (Proverbs 8:12). One leaf of this tree of life will give 
    us more comfort on a deathbed than the whole realm of human science. What is 
    it to know all the motions of the orbs and influences of the stars, and in 
    the meantime to be ignorant of Christ, the bright Morning Star (Rev. 22:16)? 
    What is it to understand the nature of minerals or precious stones, and not 
    to know Christ the true Cornerstone (Isaiah 28:16)? It is undervaluing, yes, 
    despising Christ, when with the loadstone we draw iron and straw to us—but 
    neglect him who has tried gold to bestow on us (Rev. 3:18).</p>
    <font COLOR="#0000ff"><b>
    <p align="justify">Use 2: </b></font>Is it the sign of a godly person to be 
    a Christ prizer? Then let us test our godliness by this: Do we set a high 
    estimation on Christ?</p>
    <b><i>
    <p align="justify">Question: </i>How shall we know if we truly prize Christ?</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000">
    <p align="justify">Answer 1:</font></b> If we are prizers of Christ, then we 
    prefer him in our judgments before other things. We value Christ above honor 
    and riches; the Pearl of Great Price lies nearest our heart. He who prizes 
    Christ esteems the gleanings of Christ, better than the world's vintage. He 
    counts the worst things of Christ, better than the best things of the world. 
    Moses &quot;regarded disgrace for the sake of Christ as of greater value than the 
    treasures of Egypt&quot; (Heb. 11:26). And is it thus with us? Has the price of 
    worldly things fallen? Gregory Nazianzen solemnly blessed God that he had 
    something to lose for Christ's sake. But alas, how few Nazianzens are to be 
    found! You will hear some say they have honorable thoughts of Christ—but 
    they prize their land and estate above him. The young man in the Gospel 
    preferred his bags of gold before Christ. Judas valued thirty pieces of 
    silver above him. May it not be feared, if an hour of trial comes, that 
    there are many who would rather renounce their baptism, and throw off 
    Christ's uniform—than hazard the loss of their earthly possessions for him?</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">Answer 2:</b></font> If we are the prizers of Christ, we 
    cannot live without him; things which we value, we know not how to be 
    without. A man may live without music—but not without food. A child of God 
    can lack health and friends—but he cannot lack Christ. In the absence of 
    Christ, he says, like Job, &quot;I went mourning without the sun&quot; (Job 30:28). I 
    have the <i>starlight of creature comforts</i>—but I need the<i> Sun of 
    righteousness.</i> &quot;Give me children,&quot; said Rachel, &quot;or else I die&quot; (Gen. 
    30:1). So the soul says, &quot;Lord, give me Christ, or I die. Give me one drop 
    of the <i>water of life </i>to quench my thirst.&quot; Let us test by this—do 
    they prize Christ—who can manage well enough to be without him? Give a child 
    a rattle--and it will not want gold. Give a worldling his lusts--and he will 
    be content enough without Christ. Christ is a spiritual Rock (1 Cor. 10:4). 
    Just let men have &quot;oil in the cruse&quot; and they do not care about honey from 
    this rock. If their trade has gone, they complain—but if God takes away the 
    gospel, which is the ark wherein Christ the manna is hidden, they are quiet 
    and tame enough. Do those prize Christ who can sit down content without him?</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">Answer 3: </b></font>If we are prizers of Christ, then we 
    shall not complain at any pains to get him. He who prizes gold, will dig for 
    it in the mine. &quot;My soul follows hard after God&quot; (Psalm 63:8). Plutarch 
    reports of the Gauls, an ancient people in France, that after they had 
    tasted the sweet wine of the Italian grape, they enquired after the country, 
    and never rested until they had arrived at it. He in whose eye Christ is 
    precious, never rests until he has gained him: &quot;I sought him whom my soul 
    loves; I held him, and would not let him go&quot; (Song 3:1,4).</p>
    <p align="justify">Test by this! Many say they have Christ in high 
    veneration—but they are not industrious in the use of means to obtain him. 
    If Christ would drop as a ripe fig into their mouth, they could be content 
    to have him—but they will not put themselves to too much trouble to get him. 
    Does he who will not exercise, or take the healing medicine, prize his 
    health?</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">Answer 4: </b></font>If we are prizers of Christ, then we 
    take great pleasure in Christ. What joy a man takes in, that which he counts 
    his treasure! He who prizes Christ makes him his greatest joy. He can 
    delight in Christ when other delights have gone: &quot;Even though the fig trees 
    have no blossoms, and there are no grapes on the vine; even though the olive 
    crop fails, and the fields lie empty and barren; even though the flocks die 
    in the fields, and the cattle barns are empty, yet I will rejoice in the 
    Lord! I will be joyful in the God of my salvation!&quot; (Habakkuk 3:17-18). 
    Though a <i>flower </i>in a man's garden dies, he can still delight in his
    <i>money </i>and <i>jewels</i>. He who esteems Christ can solace himself in 
    Christ, when there is a dearth of all other comforts..</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">Answer 5:</b></font> If we are prizers of Christ, then we 
    will part with our dearest pleasures for him. Paul said of the Galatians 
    that they so esteemed him that they were ready to pull out their own eyes 
    and give them to him (Gal. 4:15). He who esteems Christ, will pull out that 
    lust which is as precious as his right eye! A wise man will throw away a 
    poison for a medicine. He who sets a high value on Christ will part with his 
    pride, unjust gain and sinful ways (Isaiah 30:32). He will set his feet on 
    the neck of his sins.</p>
    <p align="justify">Test by this! How can they be said to prize Christ--who 
    will not leave a vanity for Him; or who prefer a damning pleasure before a 
    saving Christ!</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">Answer 6:</b></font> If we are prizers of Christ, we 
    shall think we cannot have him at too dear a rate. We may buy gold too 
    dearly but we cannot purchase Christ too dearly. Though we part with our 
    blood for him, it is no lost bargain. The apostles rejoiced that they were 
    graced so much as to be disgraced for Christ (Acts 5:41). They esteemed 
    their fetters more precious than bracelets of gold. Do not let him who 
    refuses to bear his cross, say that he prizes Christ. &quot;But since he has no 
    root, he lasts only a short time. When trouble or persecution comes because 
    of the word, he quickly falls away.&quot; (Matt. 13:21).</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">Answer 7:</b></font> If we are prizers of Christ, we will 
    be willing to help others to get a part in him. That which we esteem 
    excellent, we are desirous our friend should have a share in it. If a man 
    has found a spring of water, he will call others that they may drink and 
    satisfy their thirst. Do we commend Christ to others? Do we take them by the 
    hand and lead them to Christ? This shows how few prize Christ, because they 
    do not make more effort that their relations should have a part in him. They 
    get land and riches for their posterity—but have no care to leave them the 
    Pearl of Great Price as their portion.</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">Answer 8: </b></font>If we are prizers of Christ, then we 
    prize him in health as well as in sickness; when we are in wealth, as well 
    as when we are in poverty. A friend is prized at all times; the Rose of 
    Sharon is always sweet. He who values his Savior aright has as precious 
    thoughts of him in a day of prosperity—as in a day of adversity. The wicked 
    make use of Christ only when they are in straits—as the elders of Gilead 
    went to Jephthah, when they were in distress (Judges 11:7). Themistocles 
    complained of the Athenians, that they only ran to him as they did to a 
    tree, to shelter them in a storm. The wicked desire Christ only for shelter. 
    The Hebrews never chose their judges except when they were in some imminent 
    danger. Godless people never look for Christ except at death, when they are 
    in danger of hell.</p>
    <font COLOR="#0000ff"><b>
    <p align="justify">Use 3:</b></font> As we would prove to the world that we 
    have the impress of godliness on us, let us be prizers of Jesus Christ; he 
    is elect, precious. Christ is the wonder of beauty. Pliny said of the 
    mulberry tree that there is nothing in it but what is therapeutic and 
    useful: the fruit, leaves and bark. So there is nothing in Christ but what 
    is precious. His name is precious, his virtues precious, his blood 
    precious—more precious than the world.</p>
    <p align="justify">Oh, then, let us have endearing thoughts of Christ, let 
    him be accounted our chief treasure and delight.<b> This is the reason why 
    millions perish—because they do not prize Christ. </b>Christ is the door by 
    which men are to enter heaven (John 10:9). If they do not know this door, or 
    are so proud that they will not stoop to go in at it, how can they be saved? 
    That we may have Christ-admiring thoughts, let us consider:</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">1. We cannot prize Christ at too high a rate.</b></font> 
    We may prize other things above their value. That is our sin. We commonly 
    overrate the creature; we think there is more in it than there is; therefore 
    God withers our gourd, because we over-prize it. But we cannot raise our 
    esteem of Christ high enough. He is beyond all value! There is no ruby or 
    diamond but the jeweler can set a fair price on it. He can say it is worth 
    so much and no more. But Christ's worth can never be fully known. No 
    seraphim can set a due value on him. His are unsearchable riches (Eph. 3:8). 
    Christ is more precious than the soul, than the angels, than heaven.</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">2. Jesus Christ has highly prized us.</b></font> He took 
    our flesh upon him (Heb. 2:16). He made his soul an offering for us (Isaiah 
    53:10). How precious our salvation was to Christ! Shall not we prize and 
    adore him who has put such a value upon us?</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">3. Not to prize Christ is great imprudence. </b></font>
    Christ is our guide to glory. It is folly for a man to slight his guide. He 
    is our physician (Mal. 4:2). It is folly to despise our physician.</p>
    <p align="justify">The ungodly choose things of no value, before Christ! 
    &quot;You blind fools!&quot; (Matthew 23:17). If a person chooses an <i>apple </i>
    before a <i>priceless diamond</i>, he is judged to be a fool. How many such
    <b>idiots </b>are there, who choose the gaudy, empty things of this 
    life--before the Prince of Glory! Will not Satan beggar them at last for 
    fools?</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">4. Some slight Christ</b></font> now and say, &quot;There is 
    no beauty that we should desire him&quot; (Isaiah 53:2). There is a day coming 
    shortly when Christ will as much slight them. He will set as light by them 
    as they do by him. He will say, &quot;I know you not&quot; (Luke 13:27). What a 
    slighting word that will be, when men cry, &quot;Lord Jesus, save us!&quot; and he 
    says, &quot;I was offered to you but you would would not have me; you scorned me, 
    and now I will scorn you. Depart from me, I do not know you!&quot; This is all 
    that sinners get by rejecting the Lord of life. At the day of <i>judgment</i>, 
    Christ will slight those who have slighted him in the day of <i>grace</i>.</p>

    8. A godly man WEEPS.</p>
    </b></font></h2>
    <p align="justify">David sometimes <i>sang with his harp</i>; and sometimes 
    the<i> organ of his eye </i>wept: &quot;I water my couch with my tears&quot; (Psalm 
    6:6). Christ calls his spouse his &quot;dove&quot; (Song 2:14). The dove is a weeping 
    creature. <i>Grace dissolves and liquefies the soul</i>, causing a spiritual 
    thaw. <i>The sorrow of the heart runs out at the eye </i>(Psalm 31:9).</p>
    <p align="justify">The Rabbis report that the same night on which Israel 
    departed from Egypt towards Canaan, all the <i>idols </i>of Egypt were 
    broken down by lightning and earthquake. So at that very time at which men 
    go forth from their natural condition towards heaven, all the <i>idols of 
    sin </i>in the heart must be broken down by repentance! A <i>melting heart</i> 
    is the chief branch of the covenant of grace (Ezek. 36:26), and the product 
    of the Spirit: &quot;I will pour upon the house of David the spirit of grace, and 
    they shall look upon me whom they have pierced, <i>and they shall mourn for 
    him&quot; </i>(Zech. 12:10).</p>
    <font COLOR="#0000ff"><b>
    <p align="justify">Question: But why is a godly man a weeper? </b></font>Is 
    not sin pardoned, which is the ground of joy? Has he not had a transforming 
    work upon his heart? Why, then, does he weep?</p>
    <i>
    <p align="justify">Answer:</i> A godly man finds enough reasons for weeping:</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">1. He weeps for indwelling sin</b></font>, the law in his 
    members (Romans 7:23), the outbursts and first risings of sin. His nature is 
    a poisoned fountain. A regenerate person grieves that he carries with him, 
    that which is enmity to God! His heart is like a wide sea in which there are 
    innumerable <i>creeping things </i>(Psalm 104:25)—vain, sinful thoughts. A 
    child of God laments <i>hidden </i>wickedness; he has more evil in him than 
    he knows of. There are those <i>windings </i>in his heart which he cannot 
    trace—an unknown world of sin. &quot;Who can understand his errors?&quot; (Psalm 
    19:12).</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">2. A godly man weeps for clinging corruption.</b></font> 
    If he could get rid of sin, there would be some comfort—but he cannot shake 
    off this viper! Sin cleaves to him like leprosy! Though a child of God 
    forsakes his sin—yet sin will not forsake him. &quot;Concerning the rest of the
    <i>beasts</i>, they had their <i>dominion </i>taken away: yet their <i>lives
    </i>were prolonged for a season&quot; (Dan. 7:12). So though the <i>dominion </i>
    of sin is taken away—yet its life is prolonged for a season; and while sin
    <i>lives</i>, it <i>molests! </i>The Persians were daily enemies to the 
    Romans and would always be invading their frontiers. So sin &quot;wars against 
    the soul&quot; (1 Pet. 2:11). And there is no cessation of war—until death. Will 
    not this cause tears?</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">3. A child of God weeps that he is sometimes overcome by 
    the prevalence of corruption.</b></font> &quot;For I do not do the good that I 
    want to do, but I practice the evil that I do not want to do.&quot; (Romans 
    7:19). Paul was like a man carried <i>down</i>stream. How often a saint is 
    overpowered by pride and passion! When David had sinned, he steeped his soul 
    in the <i>brinish tears of repentance</i>. It cannot but grieve a regenerate 
    person to think he should be so foolish as, after he has felt the smart of 
    sin—still to put this fire in his bosom again!</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">4. A godly heart grieves that he can be no more holy.</b></font> 
    It troubles him that he shoots so short of the rule and standard which God 
    has set. &quot;I would&quot;, says he, &quot;love the Lord with all my heart. But how 
    defective my love is! How far short I come of what I <i>should </i>be; no, 
    of what I might have been! What can I see in my life—but either <i>blanks
    </i>or <i>blots</i>?&quot;</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">5. A godly man sometimes weeps out of the sense of God's 
    love.</b></font> Gold is the finest and most solid of all the metals—yet it 
    is soonest melted in the fire. <i>Gracious </i>hearts, which are <i>golden
    </i>hearts, are the soonest melted into tears by the fire of God's love. I 
    once knew a holy man, who was walking in his garden and shedding plenty of 
    tears, when a friend came on him accidentally and asked him why he wept. He 
    broke forth into this pathetic expression: &quot;Oh, the love of Christ! Oh, the 
    love of Christ!&quot; Thus have we seen the cloud melted into <i>water</i>, by 
    the sunbeams.</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">6. A godly person weeps because the sins he commits are 
    in some sense worse than the sins of other men. </b></font>The sin of a 
    justified person is very odious:</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">(i) The sin of a justified person is odious—because he 
    acts <i>contrary </i>to his own principles.</b></font> He sins not only 
    against the rule—but against his principles, against his knowledge, vows, 
    prayers, hopes, experiences. He knows how dearly sin will cost him—yet he 
    adventures upon the forbidden fruit!</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">(ii) The sin of a justified person is odious, because it 
    is a sin of unkindness</b></font> (1 Kings 11:9). Peter's denying of Christ 
    was a sin against <i>love</i>. Christ had enrolled him among the apostles. 
    He had taken him up into the Mount of Transfiguration and shown him the 
    glory of heaven in a vision. Yet after all this dazzling mercy—it was base 
    ingratitude, that he should deny Christ! This made him go out and &quot;weep 
    bitterly&quot; (Matt. 26:75). He baptized himself, as it were, in his own tears!
    <i>The sins of the godly go nearest to God's heart. </i>The sins of others
    <i>anger </i>God; the sins of the godly <i>grieve </i>him! The sins of the 
    wicked pierce Christ's <i>side! </i>The sins of the godly wound his <i>
    heart!</i> The unkindness of a <i>spouse, </i>goes nearest to the heart of 
    her husband.</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">(iii) The sin of a justified person is odious, because it 
    reflects more dishonor upon God.</b></font> &quot;By this deed you have given 
    great occasion to the enemies of the Lord to blaspheme&quot; (2 Sam. 12:14). The 
    sins of God's people put <i>black spots on the face of piety</i>. Thus we 
    see what cause there is why a child of God should weep even after 
    conversion. &quot;Can whoever sows such things refrain from tears?&quot;</p>
    <p align="justify">Now this sorrow of a godly man for sin, is not a 
    despairing sorrow. He does not mourn without hope. &quot;Iniquities prevail 
    against me&quot; (Psalm 65:3)—there is the holy <i>soul weeping</i>. &quot;As for our 
    transgressions, you shall purge them away&quot;—there is <i>faith triumphing</i>.</p>
    <p align="justify">Godly sorrow is excellent. There is as much difference 
    between the sorrow of a godly man, and the sorrow of a wicked man—as between 
    the water of a spring which is clear and sweet, and the water of the sea 
    which is salt and brackish. <font COLOR="#008000"><b>A godly man's sorrow 
    has these three qualifications:</p>
    </b></font><b>
    <p align="justify">(a) Godly sorrow is INWARD.</b> It is a sorrow of <i>soul</i>. 
    Hypocrites &quot;disfigure their <i>faces</i>&quot; (Matt. 6:16). Godly sorrow goes 
    deep. It is a &quot;pricking at the heart&quot; (Acts 2:37). True sorrow is a 
    spiritual martyrdom, therefore called &quot;soul affliction&quot; (Lev. 23:29).</p>
    <b>
    <p align="justify">(b) Godly sorrow is SINCERE.</b> It is more for the evil 
    that is <i>in </i>sin—than the evil which follows <i>after </i>sin. It is 
    more for the <i>spot—</i>than the <i>sting</i>. Hypocrites weep for sin only 
    as it brings affliction. Hypocrites never send forth the streams of their 
    tears, except when God's judgments are approaching.</p>
    <b>
    <p align="justify">(c) Godly sorrow is INFLUENTIAL. </b>It makes the heart 
    better: &quot;by the sadness of the countenance, the heart is made better&quot; 
    (Eccles. 7:3). Divine tears not only <i>wet</i>—but <i>wash</i>; they purge 
    out the love of sin!</p>
    <font COLOR="#0000ff"><b>
    <p align="justify">Use 1.</b></font> How far from being godly are those who 
    scarcely ever shed a tear for sin! If they lose a near relation—they weep. 
    But though they are in danger of losing God and their souls—they do not 
    weep. How few know what it is to be in an agony for sin, or what a broken 
    heart means! Their eyes are not like the &quot;fishpools in Heshbon&quot;, full of 
    water (Song 7:4)—but rather like the mountains of Gilboa, which had &quot;no dew&quot; 
    upon them (2 Sam. 1:21). It was a greater plague for Pharaoh to have his <i>
    heart turned into stone</i>—than to have his <i>rivers turned into blood.</p>
    </i>
    <p align="justify">The wicked, if they sometimes shed a tear—are never the 
    better. They go on in wickedness, and do not drown their sins in their 
    tears!</p>
    <font COLOR="#0000ff"><b>
    <p align="justify">Use 2:</b></font> Let us strive for this divine 
    characteristic. Be weepers! This is &quot;a repentance not to be repented of&quot; (2 
    Cor. 7:10). It is reported of Bradford, the martyr, that he was of a melting 
    spirit; he seldom sat down to his meal but some tears trickled down his 
    cheeks. There are two lavers to wash away sin: <i>blood </i>and <i>tears</i>. 
    The <i>blood of Christ </i>washes away the guilt of sin; <i>our tears </i>
    wash away the filth of sin. </p>
    <p align="justify">Repenting tears are <b>precious</b>. God puts them in his 
    bottle (Psalm 56:8). Repenting tears are <b>beautifying</b>. To God—a tear 
    in the eye, adorns more than a ring on the finger. Oil makes the <i>face </i>
    shine (Psalm 104:15). Tears make the <i>heart </i>shine. Repenting tears are
    <b>comforting</b>. A <i>sinner's </i>mirth turns to <i>melancholy</i>. A <i>
    saint's </i>mourning turns to <i>music!</i> Repentance may be compared to 
    myrrh, which though it is bitter to the taste—is comforting to the spirits. 
    Repentance may be bitter to the <i>flesh</i>, but it is most refreshing to 
    the <i>soul</i>. Wax which <i>melts </i>is fit for the seal. A melting soul 
    is fit to take the stamp of all heavenly blessing. Let us give Christ the <i>
    water of our tears—</i>and he will give us the <i>wine of his blood!</i></p>

    9. A godly man is a lover of the WORD</p>
    </b></font></h2>
    <p align="justify">&quot;O how love I your law!&quot; Psalm 119:97</p>
    <font COLOR="#0000ff"><b>
    <p align="justify">1. A godly man loves the WRITTEN Word </p>
    </b></font>
    <p align="justify">Chrysostom compares the Scripture to a garden set with 
    nuts and flowers. A godly man delights to walk in this garden and sweetly 
    solace himself. He loves every branch and part of the Word:</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">1. He loves the COUNSELING part of the Word, as it is a 
    directory and rule of life.</b></font> The Word is the sole rule of 
    Christian duty. It contains in it things to be <i>believed </i>and <i>
    practiced</i>. A godly man loves the teachings of the Word.</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">2. He loves the THREATENING part of the Word. </b></font>
    The Scripture is like the Garden of Eden: as it has a <i>tree of life </i>in 
    it, so it has a <i>flaming sword</i> at its gates. This is the threatening 
    of the Word. It flashes fire in the face of every person who goes on 
    obstinately in wickedness. &quot;Surely God will crush the heads of his enemies, 
    the hairy crowns of those who go on in their sins.&quot; (Psalm 68:21). The Word 
    gives no indulgence to evil. It will not let a man halt between <i>God </i>
    and <i>sin</i>. The true mother would not let the child be divided (1 Kings 
    3:26), and God will not have the heart divided. The Word thunders out 
    threatenings against the very appearance of evil. It is like that flying 
    roll full of curses (Zech. 5:1).</p>
    <p align="justify">A godly man loves the <i>imprecations </i>of the Word. He 
    knows there is love in every threat. God would not have us perish; he 
    therefore mercifully threatens us, so that he may scare us from sin. God's 
    threats are like the life-buoy, which shows the rocks in the sea and 
    threatens death to such as come near. The threat is a curbing bit to check 
    us, so that we may not run in full stride to hell. There is mercy in every 
    threat.</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">3. He loves the CONSOLATORY part of the Word—the 
    promises.</b></font> He goes feeding on these as Samson went on his way 
    eating the honeycomb (Judges 14:8,9). The promises are all marrow and 
    sweetness. They are our <i>refreshing draught </i>when we are fainting; they 
    are the conduits of the water of life. &quot;In the multitude of my thoughts 
    within me your comforts delight my soul&quot; (Psalm 94:19). The promises were 
    David's harp to drive away sad thoughts; they were the breast which gave him 
    the milk of divine consolation.</p>
    <b>
    <p align="justify">A godly man shows his love to the Written Word:</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050">
    <p align="justify">(1) By diligently READING it.</font></b> The noble 
    Bereans &quot;searched the Scriptures daily&quot; (Acts 17:11). Apollos was mighty in 
    the Scriptures (Acts 18:24). The Word is our Magna Charta for heaven; we 
    should be daily reading over this charter. The Word shows what is truth, and 
    what is error. It is the field where the pearl of great price is hidden. How 
    we should dig for this pearl! A godly man's heart is the library to hold the 
    Word of God; it dwells richly in him (Col. 3:16). It is reported of 
    Melanchthon that when he was young, he always carried the Bible with him and 
    read it greedily. The Word has a double work: to <i>teach </i>us and to <i>
    judge </i>us. Those who will not be taught by the Word, shall be judged by 
    the Word. Oh, let us make ourselves familiar with the Scripture! What if it 
    should be as in the times of Diocletian, who commanded by proclamation that 
    the Bible be burned? Or as in Queen Mary's days, when it spelled death to 
    have a Bible in English? <i>By diligent conversing with Scripture, we may 
    carry a Bible in our heads!</p>
    </i><font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">(2) By frequently MEDITATING on it. </b></font>&quot;It is my
    <i>meditation </i>all the day&quot; (Psalm 119:97). A pious soul meditates on the
    <i>truth </i>and <i>holiness </i>of the Word. He not only has a few 
    transient thoughts—but leaves his mind <i>steeping </i>in the Scripture. By 
    meditation, he sucks honey from this sweet flower, and ruminates on holy 
    truths in his mind.</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">(3) By DELIGHTING in it. </b></font>It is his <i>
    recreation</i>. &quot;When your words came, I ate them; they were my joy and my 
    heart's delight&quot; (Jer. 15:16). Never did a man take such delight in a dish 
    that he loved, as the prophet did in the Word. And indeed, how can a saint 
    choose but take great pleasure in the Word? All of his eternal hopes are 
    contained in it. Does not a son take pleasure in reading his father's will 
    and testament, in which he bequeaths his estate to him?</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">(4) By HIDING it.</b></font> &quot;Your word have I hid in my 
    heart&quot; (Psalm 119:11) —as one hides a treasure so that it should not be 
    stolen. The Word is the jewel; the heart is the cabinet where it must be 
    locked up. Many hide the Word in their memory—but not in their heart. And 
    why would David enclose the Word in his heart? &quot;That I might be kept from 
    sinning against you.&quot; As a man would carry an antidote about him when he 
    comes near an infected place, so a godly man carries the Word in his heart 
    as a spiritual antidote to preserve him from the infection of sin. Why have 
    so many been poisoned with error, others with moral vice—but because they 
    have not hidden the Word as a holy antidote in their heart?</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">(5) By DEFENDING it.</b></font> A wise man will not let 
    his land be taken from him; but will defend his title. David looked upon the 
    Word as his land of inheritance: &quot;Your testimonies have I taken as a 
    heritage forever&quot; (Psalm 119:111). And do you think he would let his 
    inheritance be wrested out of his hands? A godly man will not only dispute 
    for the Word but die for it: &quot;I saw under the altar the souls of those who 
    were slain for the word of God&quot; (Rev. 6:9).</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">(6) By PREFERRING it above most precious things.</b></font>
    </p>
    <p align="justify">(a) Above food. &quot;I have esteemed the words of his mouth 
    more than my necessary food&quot; (Job 23:12). </p>
    <p align="justify">(b) Above riches. &quot;The law of your mouth is better unto 
    me than thousands of gold and silver&quot; (Psalm 119:72). </p>
    <p align="justify">(c) Above worldly honor. Memorable is the story of King 
    Edward the Sixth. On the day of his coronation, when they presented three 
    swords before him, signifying to him that he was monarch of three kingdoms, 
    the king said, &quot;There is still one sword missing.&quot; On being asked what that 
    was, he answered, &quot;The Holy Bible, which is the &quot;Sword of the Spirit&quot; and is 
    to be preferred before these ensigns of royalty.&quot;</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">(7) By TALKING about it.</b></font> &quot;My tongue shall 
    speak of your word&quot; (Psalm 119:172). As a covetous man talks of his rich 
    purchase, so a godly man speaks of the Word. What a treasure it is, how full 
    of beauty and sweetness! Those whose mouths the devil has gagged, who never 
    speak of God's Word, indicate that they never reaped any good from it.</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">(8) By CONFORMING to it.</b></font> The Word is his 
    sundial, by which he sets his life, the balance in which he weighs his 
    actions. He copies out the Word in his daily walk: &quot;I have kept the faith&quot; 
    (2 Tim. 4:7). Paul kept the <i>doctrine </i>of faith, and lived the <i>life
    </i>of faith.</p>
    <i>
    <p align="justify">Question:</i> Why is a godly man a lover of the Word? </p>
    <i>
    <p align="justify">Answer:</i> Because of the excellence of the Word.</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">1. The Word is our pillar of fire to guide us.</b></font> 
    It shows us what rocks we are to avoid; it is the map by which we sail to 
    the new Jerusalem.</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">2. The Word is a spiritual mirror through which we may 
    see our own hearts.</b></font> The mirror of nature, which the heathen had, 
    revealed spots in their lives—but this mirror reveals spots in the 
    imagination; that mirror revealed the spots of their unrighteousness, this 
    reveals the spots of our righteousness. &quot;When the commandment came, sin 
    revived, and I died&quot; (Romans 7:9). When the Word came like a mirror, all my 
    opinion of self-righteousness died.</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">3. The Word of God is a sovereign comfort in distress.
    </b></font>While we follow this cloud, the rock follows us— &quot;This is my 
    comfort in my affliction: for your word has quickened me&quot; (Psalm 119:50)<i>. 
    Christ is the fountain of living water, the Word is the golden pipe through 
    which it runs! </i>What can revive at the hour of death but the word of life 
    (Phil. 2:16)?</p>
    <i><b>
    <p align="justify">A godly man loves the Word, because of the efficacy it 
    has had upon him</b></i>. This day-star has risen in his heart, and ushered 
    in the Sun of righteousness.</p>
    <font COLOR="#0000ff"><b>
    <p align="justify">2. A godly man loves the PREACHED Word</b></font>, which 
    is a commentary upon the Written Word. The Scriptures are the sovereign oils 
    and balsams; the preaching of the Word is the pouring of them out. The 
    Scriptures are the precious spices; the preaching of the Word is the beating 
    of these spices, which causes a wonderful fragrance and delight. The 
    Preached Word is &quot;the rod of God's strength&quot; (Psalm 110:2) and &quot;the breath 
    of his lips&quot; (Isaiah 11:4). What was once said of the city of Thebes, that 
    it was built by the sound of Amphius' harp, is much more true of soul 
    conversion—it is built by the sound of the gospel harp. Therefore the 
    preaching of the Word is called &quot;the power of God to salvation&quot; (1 Cor. 
    1:24). By this, Christ is said now to speak to us from heaven (Heb. 12:25). 
    This ministry of the Word is to be preferred before the ministry of angels.</p>
    <p align="justify">A godly man loves the preached Word, partly from the good 
    he has found by it—he has felt the dew fall with this manna—and partly 
    because of God's institution. The Lord has appointed this ordinance to save 
    him. The king's image makes the coin current. The stamp of divine authority 
    on the Preached Word makes it an instrument conducive to men's salvation.</p>
    <font COLOR="#0000ff"><b>
    <p align="justify">Use: </b></font>Let us test by this characteristic 
    whether we are godly: Are we lovers of the Word?</p>
    <p align="justify">1. <i>Do we love the <b>written </b>Word?</i> What sums 
    of money the martyrs gave for a few leaves of the Bible! Do we make the Word 
    our bosom friend? As Moses often had &quot;the rod of God&quot; in his hand, so we 
    should have &quot;the Book of God&quot; in our hand. When we need direction, do we 
    consult this sacred oracle? When we find corruptions strong, do we make use 
    of this &quot;sword of the Spirit&quot; to hew them down? When we are disconsolate, do 
    we go to this bottle of the water of life for comfort? Then we are lovers of 
    the Word! </p>
    <p align="justify">But alas, how can they who are seldom conversant with the 
    Scriptures say they love them? Their eyes begin to be sore when they look at 
    a Bible. The two testaments are hung up like rusty armor, which is seldom or 
    never made use of. The Lord wrote the law with his own finger—but though God 
    took pains to <i>write</i>, men will not take pains to <i>read</i>. They 
    would rather look at a pack of cards, than at a Bible!</p>
    <p align="justify">2. <i>Do we love the <b>preached </b>Word?</i> Do we 
    prize it in our judgments? Do we receive it into our hearts? Do we fear the 
    loss of the preached Word more than the loss of peace and trade? Is it the 
    removal of the ark, which troubles us?</p>
    <p align="justify">Again, do we attend to the Word with reverential 
    devotion? When the judge is giving his charge on the bench, all attend. When 
    the Word is preached, the great God is giving us his charge. Do we listen to 
    it as to a matter of life and death? This is a good sign that we love the 
    Word.</p>
    <p align="justify">Again, do we love the holiness of the Word (Psalm 
    119:140)? The Word is preached to beat down sin and advance holiness. Do we 
    love it for its spirituality and purity? Many love the Preached Word only 
    for its eloquence and notion. They come to a sermon as to a music lecture 
    (Ezek. 33:31,32) or as to a garden to pick flowers—but not to have their 
    lusts subdued or their hearts bettered. These are like a foolish woman who 
    paints her face—but neglects her health!</p>
    <p align="justify">Again, do we love the convictions of the Word? Do we love 
    the Word when it comes home to our conscience and shoots its arrows of 
    reproof at our sins? It is the minister's duty sometimes to reprove. He who 
    can speak smooth words in the pulpit—but does not know how to reprove, is 
    like a sword with a fine handle, but <i>without an edge</i>! &quot;Rebuke them 
    sharply&quot; (Titus 2:15). Dip the nail in oil—reprove in love—but strike the 
    nail home! Now Christian, when the Word touches on your sin and says, &quot;You 
    are the man!&quot; do you love the reproof? Can you bless God that &quot;the sword of 
    the Spirit&quot; has divided between you and your lusts? This is indeed a sign of 
    grace and shows that you are a lover of the Word.</p>
    <p align="justify">A corrupt heart loves the comforts of the Word—but not 
    the reproofs: &quot;You hate the one who <i>reproves </i>in court and despise him 
    who tells the truth!&quot; (Amos 5:10). &quot;Their eyes flash with fire!&quot; Like 
    venomous creatures that at the least touch spit poison, &quot;When they heard 
    these things, they were enraged in their hearts and gnashed their teeth at 
    him!&quot; (Acts 7:54). When Stephen touched their sins, they were furious and 
    could not endure it.</p>
    <i>
    <p align="justify">Question: </i>How shall we know that we love the reproofs 
    of the Word?</p>
    <i>
    <p align="justify">Answer</i> 1: When we desire to sit under a 
    heart-searching ministry. Who cares for medicines that will not work? A 
    godly man does not choose to sit under a ministry that will not work upon 
    his conscience.</p>
    <i>
    <p align="justify">Answer</i> 2: When we pray that the Word may meet with 
    our sins. If there is any traitorous lust in our heart, we would have it 
    found out and executed. We do not want sin <i>covered</i>—but <i>cured!</i> 
    We can open our breast to the sword of the Word and say, &quot;Lord, smite this 
    sin!&quot;</p>
    <i>
    <p align="justify">Answer</i> 3: When we are thankful for a reproof: &quot;Let a 
    righteous man strike me--it is a kindness; let him rebuke me--it is oil on 
    my head. My head will not refuse it.&quot; (Psalm 141:5). David was glad for a 
    reproof. Suppose a man were in the mouth of a lion, and another should shoot 
    the lion and save the man, would he not be thankful? So, when we are in the 
    mouth of sin, as of a lion, and the minister by a reproof shoots this sin to 
    death, shall we not be thankful? </p>
    <p align="justify">A gracious soul rejoices when the sharp lance of the Word 
    has pierced his abscess. He wears a reproof like a jewel on his ear: &quot;Like 
    an earring of gold or an ornament of fine gold is a wise man's rebuke to a 
    listening ear.&quot; (Proverbs 25:12). To conclude, it is convincing preaching 
    which must do the soul good. A nipping reproof prepares for comfort, as a 
    nipping frost prepares for the sweet flowers of spring.</p>
    <h2><p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
    <font COLOR="#ff0000"><b>
    <p align="justify">10. A godly man has the Spirit of God residing in him</p>
    </b></font></h2>
    <p align="justify">&quot;The Holy Spirit which dwells in us&quot; (2 Tim. 1:14; Gal. 
    4:6). The Holy Spirit is in the godly, in whom he flows in measure. They 
    have his presence and receive his sacred influences. When the sun comes into 
    a room, it is not the body of the sun which is there, but the beams which 
    sparkle from it. Indeed, some divines have thought that the godly have more 
    than the indwelling of the Spirit; though to say how it is more is 
    ineffable—is fitter for a more seraphic pen than mine to describe. The 
    Spirit of God reveals himself in a gracious soul in two ways:</p>
    <font COLOR="#0000ff"><b>
    <p align="justify">1. By his motions</p>
    </b></font>
    <p align="justify">These are some of that sweet perfume, which the Spirit 
    breathes upon the heart, by which it is raised into a kind of angelic frame.</p>
    <i>
    <p align="justify">Question</i> 1: But how may we distinguish the motions of 
    the Spirit from a delusion?</p>
    <i>
    <p align="justify">Answer:</i> The motions of the Spirit are always 
    consonant with the Word. The <i>Word </i>is the chariot in which the <i>
    Spirit </i>of God rides; whichever way the tide of the Word runs—that way 
    the wind of the Spirit blows.</p>
    <i>
    <p align="justify">Question</i> 2: How may the motions of the Spirit in the 
    godly be distinguished from the impulses of a natural conscience?</p>
    <i>
    <p align="justify">Answer </i>1: A natural conscience may sometimes provoke 
    to the same thing as the Spirit does—but not from the same principle. 
    Natural conscience is a spur to duty—but it drives a man to do his duties 
    for fear of hell—as the galley slave tugs at the oar for fear of being 
    beaten. Whereas the Spirit moves a child of God from a more noble 
    principle—it makes him serve God out of choice, and esteem duty his 
    privilege.</p>
    <i>
    <p align="justify">Answer</i> 2: The impulses of a natural conscience drive 
    men only to <i>easier </i>duties of religion, in which the heart is less 
    exercised, like perfunctory reading or praying. But the motions of the 
    Spirit in the godly go further, causing them to do the most irksome duties, 
    like self-reflection, self-humbling; yes, perilous duties, like confessing 
    Christ's name in times of danger. Divine motions in the heart are like new 
    wine which seeks vent. When God's Spirit possesses a man, he carries him 
    full sail through all difficulties!</p>
    <font COLOR="#0000ff"><b>
    <p align="justify">2. By his virtues</b></font>. These are various:</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">(1) God's Spirit has a TEACHING virtue. </b></font>The 
    Spirit teaches convincingly (John 16:8). He so teaches as to persuade.</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">(2) God's Spirit has a SANCTIFYING virtue. </b></font>The 
    heart is naturally polluted—but when the Spirit comes into it, he works sin 
    out and grace in. The Spirit of God was represented by the dove, an emblem 
    of purity. The Spirit makes the heart a temple of purity and a paradise for 
    pleasantness. The holy oil of consecration was nothing but a prefiguring of 
    the Spirit (Exod. 30:25). The Spirit sanctifies a man's <i>mind</i>, causing 
    it to mint holy meditations. He sanctifies his <i>will</i>, biasing it to 
    good, so that now it shall be as delightful to serve God as before it was to 
    sin against him. Sweet powders perfume the linen. So God's Spirit in a man, 
    perfumes him with holiness and makes his heart a picture of holiness.</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">(3) God's Spirit has a VIVIFYING virtue.</b></font> &quot;The 
    Spirit gives life&quot; (2 Cor. 3:6). As the blowing in an flute makes it sound, 
    so the breathing of the Spirit causes life and motion. When the prophet 
    Elijah stretched himself upon the dead child, it revived (1 Kings 17:22); so 
    God's Spirit stretching himself upon the soul, infuses life into it.</p>
    <p align="justify">As our life is from the Spirit's operations, so is our 
    liveliness: &quot;the Spirit lifted me up&quot; (Ezek. 3:14). When the heart is bowed 
    down and is listless to duty, the Spirit of God lifts it up. He puts a sharp 
    edge upon the affections; he makes <i>love </i>ardent, and <i>hope </i>
    lively. The Spirit removes the weights of the soul and gives it wings: 
    &quot;Before I was aware, my soul became like the chariots of Amminadib&quot; (Song 
    6:12). The wheels of the soul were pulled off before, and it drove on 
    heavily—but when the Spirit of the Almighty possesses a man, now he runs 
    swiftly in the ways of God, and his soul is like the chariots of Amminadib.</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">(4) God's Spirit has a REGULATING virtue.</b></font> He 
    rules and governs. God's Spirit sits paramount in the soul; he gives check 
    to the violence of corruption; he will not allow a man to be vain and loose 
    like others. The Spirit of God will not be put out of office; he exercises 
    his authority over the heart, &quot;bringing into captivity every thought to the 
    obedience of Christ&quot; (2 Cor. 10:5).</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">(5) The Spirit has a MOLLIFYING virtue. </b></font>
    Therefore he is compared to fire which softens the wax. The Spirit turns 
    flint into flesh: &quot;I will give you a heart of flesh&quot; (Ezek. 36:26). How 
    shall this be effected? &quot;I will put my Spirit within you&quot; (v.27). While the 
    heart is hard, it lies like a <i>log</i>, and is not wrought upon either by 
    judgments or by mercies—but when God's Spirit comes in, he makes a man's 
    heart as tender as his <i>eye</i>—and now it is made yielding to divine 
    impressions.</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">(6) The Spirit of God has a FORTIFYING virtue.</b></font> 
    He infuses strength and assistance for work; he is a Spirit of power (2 Tim. 
    1:7). God's Spirit carries a man above himself: &quot;strengthened with might by 
    his Spirit in the inner man&quot; (Eph. 3:16). The Spirit confirms faith and 
    animates courage. He lifts one end of the cross, and makes it lighter to 
    bear. The Spirit gives not only a sufficiency of strength—but an abundance.</p>
    <i>
    <p align="justify">Question:</i> How shall we know whether we are acting in 
    the strength of God's Spirit, or in the strength of our own abilities?</p>
    <i>
    <p align="justify">Answer</i> 1: When we humbly cast ourselves upon God for 
    assistance, as David going out against Goliath cast himself upon God for 
    help: &quot;I come to you in the name of the Lord&quot; (1 Sam. 17:45).</p>
    <i>
    <p align="justify">Answer</i> 2: When our duties are divinely qualified, and 
    we do them with pure aims.</p>
    <i>
    <p align="justify">Answer</i> 3: When we have found God going along with us, 
    we give him the glory for everything (1 Cor. 15:10). This clearly evinces 
    that the duty was carried on by the strength of God's Spirit more than by 
    any innate abilities of our own.</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">(7) God's Spirit has a COMFORTING virtue. </b></font>The 
    sky, though it is a bright and transparent body, still has interposed <i>
    clouds</i>. Just so, sadness may arise in a gracious heart (Psalm 43:5). 
    This sadness is caused usually through the malice of Satan, who, if he 
    cannot <i>destroy </i>us, will <i>disturb </i>us. But God's Spirit within 
    us, sweetly cheers and revives. He is called the <i>parakletos</i>, &quot;the 
    Comforter&quot; (John 14:16). These comforts are real and palpable. Hence it is 
    called &quot;the seal of the Spirit&quot; (Eph. 1:13). When a deed is sealed, it is 
    firm and unquestionable. So when a Christian has the seal of the Spirit, his 
    comforts are confirmed. Every godly man has these revivings of the Spirit in 
    some degree; he has the seeds and beginnings of joy, though the flower is 
    not fully ripe and blown.</p>
    <b><font COLOR="#0000ff">
    <p align="justify">Question: How does the Spirit give comfort?</p>
    </font><font COLOR="#008000">
    <p align="justify">Answer 1: By showing us that we are in a state of grace.
    </font></b>A Christian cannot always see his riches. The work of grace may 
    be written in the heart, like shorthand which a Christian cannot read. The 
    Spirit gives him a key to open these dark characters, and spell out his 
    adoption, whereupon he has joy and peace. &quot;We have received the Spirit which 
    is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God&quot; 
    (1 Cor. 2:12).</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">Answer 2: The Spirit comforts by giving us some ravishing 
    apprehensions of God's love. </b></font>&quot;The love of God is shed abroad in 
    our hearts by the Holy Spirit&quot; (Romans 5:5). God's love is a box of precious 
    ointment, and it is only the Spirit who can break this box open, and fill us 
    with its sweet perfume.</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">Answer 3: The Spirit comforts by taking us to the blood 
    of Christ. </b></font>As when a man is weary and ready to faint, we take him 
    to the water, and he is refreshed; so when we are fainting under the burden 
    of sin, the Spirit takes us to the fountain of Christ's blood: &quot;In that day 
    there shall be a fountain opened . . . &quot; (Zech. 13:1). The Spirit enables us 
    to drink the <i>waters of justification </i>which run out of Christ's side. 
    The Spirit applies whatever Christ has purchased; he shows us that our sins 
    are done away in Christ, and though we are spotted and defiled in 
    ourselves—we are undefiled in our Head, Christ.</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">Answer 4: The Spirit comforts by enabling conscience to 
    comfort. </b></font>The child must be taught, before it can speak. The 
    Spirit opens the mouth of conscience, and helps it to speak and witness to a 
    man that his state is good, whereupon he begins to receive comfort: 
    &quot;conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Spirit&quot; (Romans 9:1). 
    Conscience draws up a certificate for a man, then the Holy Spirit comes and 
    signs the certificate.</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">Answer 5: The Spirit conveys the oil of joy through two 
    golden pipes:</p>
    </b></font><b>
    <p align="justify">1. <i>The ORDINANCES</i>. </b>As Christ in prayer had his 
    countenance changed (Luke 9:29) and there was a glorious luster upon his 
    face; so often in the use of holy ordinances the godly have such raptures of 
    joy and soul transfigurations, that they have been carried above the world, 
    and despised all things below.</p>
    <b>
    <p align="justify">2. <i>The PROMISES</i>. </b>The promises are comforting:
    </p>
    <p align="justify">(1) For their <b>sureness </b>(Romans 4:16). God in the 
    promises has put his truth in pawn. </p>
    <p align="justify">(2) For their <b>suitableness</b>, being calculated for 
    the Christian's every condition. The promises are like an herb garden. There 
    is no disease but some herb may be found there to cure it. The promises of 
    themselves cannot comfort--but only as the Spirit enables us to suck 
    consolation from these honeycombs. The promises are like a <i>still </i>full 
    of herbs—but this still will not drop unless the fire is put under it. So 
    when the Spirit of God (who is compared to fire) is put to the still of the 
    promises, then they distill consolation into the soul. Thus we see how the 
    Spirit is in the godly by his virtues.</p>
    <i>
    <p align="justify">Objection:</i> But is being <i>filled </i>with the Spirit 
    the sign of a godly man? Are not the wicked said to <i>partake </i>of the 
    Holy Spirit (Heb. 6:4)?</p>
    <i>
    <p align="justify">Answer:</i> Wicked men may <i>partake </i>of the Spirit's 
    working—but not of his <i>indwelling</i>. They may have God's Spirit move <i>
    upon </i>them; but the godly have him enter <i>into </i>them (Ezek. 3:24).</p>
    <i>
    <p align="justify">Objection:</i> But the unregenerate <i>taste </i>the 
    heavenly gift (Heb. 6:4).</p>
    <i>
    <p align="justify">Answer:</i> It is with them as it is with cooks who may 
    have a <i>smack </i>and <i>taste </i>of the meat they are dressing—but they 
    are not nourished by it. <i>Tasting </i>there is opposed to <i>eating</i>. 
    The godly have not only a drop or taste of the Spirit—but he is in them like 
    a river of living water (John 7:38).</p>
    <font COLOR="#0000ff"><b>
    <p align="justify">Use 1: </b></font>It brands those as ungodly who do not 
    have God's Spirit. &quot;If anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he does 
    not belong to Christ&quot; (Romans 8:9). And if he does not belong to Christ—then 
    whose is he? To what regiment does he belong? It is the misery of a 
    sinner—that he does not have God's Spirit. I think it is very offensive to 
    hear men who never had God's Spirit say, &quot;Take not your holy spirit from us&quot; 
    (Psalm 51:11). Will those who are drunkards and swearers say they have God's 
    Spirit in them? Do those who are malicious and unclean have God's Spirit? It 
    would be blasphemy to say these have the Spirit. Will the blessed Spirit 
    leave his celestial palace to come and live in a foul prison? A sinner's 
    heart is a jail, both for darkness and obnoxiousness, and will God's free 
    Spirit be confined to a prison (Psalm 51:12)? <i>A sinner's heart is the 
    emblem of hell. </i>What would God's Spirit do there? Wicked hearts are not 
    a temple—but a pigsty, where the unclean spirit makes his abode—&quot;the prince 
    of the power of the air, the spirit who now works in the children of 
    disobedience&quot; (Eph. 2:2). </p>
    <p align="justify">We would be loath to live in a house haunted by evil 
    spirits; a sinner's heart is haunted. &quot;After the sop Satan entered&quot; (John 
    13:27). Satan abuses the <i>godly</i>—but enters into the <i>wicked</i>. 
    When the devils went into the herd of swine, &quot;the whole herd rushed down the 
    steep bank into the sea and perished in the water&quot; (Matt. 8:32). Why is it 
    that men rush so greedily to the commission of sin—but because the devil has 
    entered into these swine!</p>
    <b>
    <p align="justify">Secondly</b>, this cuts off from godliness those who not 
    only lack the Spirit—but deride him—like those Jews who said, &quot;These men are 
    full of new wine&quot; (Acts 2:13). And indeed, so the apostles were—they were 
    full of the wine of the Spirit. How God's Spirit is scoffed at by the sons 
    of Belial! O wretches, to make those tongues which should be organs of God's 
    praise, into instruments to blaspheme! Have you none to throw your jests at 
    but the Spirit? Deriding the Spirit comes very near to despising him. How 
    can men be sanctified but by the Spirit? Therefore to reproach him is to 
    make merry with their own damnation.</p>
    <font COLOR="#0000ff"><b>
    <p align="justify">Use 2:</b></font> As you would be listed in the number of 
    the godly, strive for the blessed indwelling of the Spirit. Pray with 
    Melanchthon, &quot;Lord, inflame my soul with your Holy Spirit&quot;; and with the 
    spouse, &quot;Awake, O north wind; and come, O south wind; and blow upon my 
    garden&quot; (Song 4:16). As a mariner would desire a wind to drive him to sea, 
    so beg for the prosperous gales of the Spirit and the promise may add wings 
    to prayer. &quot;If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your 
    children: how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to 
    those who ask him?&quot; (Luke 11:13). God's Spirit is a rich jewel. Go to God 
    for him: &quot;Lord, give me your Spirit. Where is the jewel you promised me? 
    When shall my soul be like Gideon's fleece, wet with the dew of heaven?&quot;</p>
    <font COLOR="#0000ff"><b>
    <p align="justify">Consider how necessary the Spirit is.</b></font> Without 
    him we can do nothing acceptable to God:</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">1. We cannot PRAY without him. </b></font>He is a Spirit 
    of supplication (Zech. 12:10). He helps both the inventiveness and the 
    affection: &quot;The Spirit helps us with sighs and groans&quot; (Romans 8:26).</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">2. We cannot resist TEMPTATION without him. </b></font>
    &quot;You will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you&quot; (Acts 1:8). 
    He who has the <i>tide of corrupt nature</i>, and the <i>wind of temptation</i>, 
    must of necessity be carried down the stream of sin—if the contrary wind of 
    the Spirit does not blow.</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">3. We cannot be FRUITFUL without the Spirit.</b></font> 
    &quot;The golden rain from heaven waters the thirsty hearts.&quot; Why is the Spirit 
    compared to dew and rain—but to show us how unable we are to bring forth a 
    crop of grace unless the dew of God falls upon us?</p>

    <p align="justify">4. Without the Spirit, no ORDINANCE is effectual to us.</b></font> 
    Ordinances are the conduit pipes of grace—but the Spirit is the spring. Some 
    are content that they have a &quot;Levite for their priest&quot; (Judges 17:13)—but 
    never look any further. As if a merchant should be content that his ship has 
    good tackling and is well manned, though it never has a gale of wind. The 
    ship of ordinances will not carry us to heaven, though an angel is the 
    pilot, unless the wind of God's Spirit blows. The Spirit is the soul of the 
    Word, without which it is but a dead letter. Ministers may prescribe 
    medicine—but it is God's Spirit who must make it work! Our hearts are like 
    David's body when it grew old: &quot;they covered him with clothes—but he got no 
    heat&quot; (1 Kings 1:1). So though the ministers of God ply us with prayers and 
    counsel as with hot clothes—yet we are cold and chilly until God's Spirit 
    comes; and then we say, like the disciples, &quot;Did not our heart burn within 
    us!&quot; (Luke 24:32). Oh, therefore, what need we have of the Spirit!</p>

    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">1. Acknowledge God's distinguishing love.</b></font> The 
    Spirit is an earmark of election (1 John 3:24). Christ gave the bag to Judas 
    but not his Spirit. The Spirit is a love token. Where God gives his Spirit 
    as a pawn, he gives himself as a portion. The Spirit is a comprehensive 
    blessing; he is put for all good things (Matt. 7:11). What would you be 
    without the Spirit but like so many carcasses? Without this, Christ would 
    not profit you. The blood of God is not enough without the breath of God. Oh 
    then, be thankful for the Spirit. This lodestone will never stop drawing you 
    until it has drawn you up to heaven.</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">2. If you have this Spirit, do not grieve him </b></font>
    (Eph. 4:30). Shall we grieve our Comforter?</p>
    <i>
    <p align="justify">Question: </i>How do we grieve the Spirit?</p>
    <i>
    <p align="justify">Answer</i> 1: When we unkindly repel his motions. The 
    Spirit sometimes whispers in our ears and calls to us as God did to Jacob, 
    &quot;Arise, go up to Bethel&quot; (Gen. 35:1). So the Spirit says, &quot;Arise, go to 
    prayer, retire to meet your God.&quot; Now when we stifle these motions and 
    entertain temptations to vanity, this is grieving the Spirit. If we check 
    the <i>motions </i>of the Spirit, we shall lose the <i>comforts </i>of the 
    Spirit.</p>
    <i>
    <p align="justify">Answer</i> 2: We grieve the Spirit when we deny the work 
    of the Spirit in our hearts. If someone gives another person a gift, and he 
    should deny it and say he never received it, this would be to abuse the love 
    of his friend. So, Christian, when God has given you his Spirit, witnessed 
    by those meltings of heart and passionate desires for heaven—yet you deny 
    that you ever had any renewing work of the Spirit in you, this is base 
    ingratitude and grieves the good Spirit. Renounce the sinful works of the <i>
    flesh</i>—but do not deny the gracious work of the <i>Spirit</i>.</p>

    <p align="justify">11. A godly man is a HUMBLE man</p>
    </b></font></h2>
    <p align="justify">Augustine calls humility &quot;the mother of the grace.&quot; But 
    before I show you who the humble man is, I shall lay down three 
    distinctions:</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">1. I distinguish between being humbled and humble</p>
    </b></font>
    <p align="justify">A man may be humbled and not humble. A sinner may be 
    humbled by affliction. His <i>condition </i>is low, but not his <i>
    disposition</i>. A godly man is not only humbled, but humble. His heart is 
    as low as his condition.</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">2. I distinguish between outward and inward humility</p>
    </b></font>
    <p align="justify">There is a great deal of difference between humble 
    behavior and a humble spirit.</p>
    <p align="justify">(1) A person may behave humbly towards others—yet be 
    proud. Who more humble than Absalom in his outward behavior? &quot;When people 
    tried to bow before him, Absalom wouldn't let them. Instead, he took them by 
    the hand and embraced them.&quot; (2 Sam. 15:5). But though he acted humbly, he 
    aspired to the crown (v. 10).<i> Here was pride dressed in humility's 
    mantle!</p>
    </i>
    <p align="justify">(2) A person may behave humbly towards God—yet be proud. 
    &quot;Ahab put on sackcloth and fasted and went softly&quot; (1 Kings 21:27)—but his 
    heart was not humble. A man may bow his head like a bulrush—yet lift up the 
    ensigns of pride in his heart.</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">3. I distinguish between humility and policy</p>
    </b></font>
    <p align="justify">Many make a show of humility to achieve their own ends. 
    The Papists seem to be the most humble, mortified saints—but it is rather 
    subtlety than humility. For by this means, they get the revenues of the 
    earth into their possession. All this they may do, and yet have no 
    godliness.</p>
    <b>
    <p align="justify">Question: How may a Christian know that he is humble—and 
    consequently godly?</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000">
    <p align="justify">Answer 1: A humble soul is emptied of all swelling 
    thoughts of himself. </font></b>Bernard calls humility a self-annihilation. 
    &quot;You will save the humble&quot; (Job 22:29). In the Hebrew it is &quot;him that is of 
    low eyes&quot;. A humble man has lower thoughts of himself than others can have 
    of him. David, though a king, still looked upon himself as a worm: &quot;I am a 
    worm, and no man&quot; (Psalm 22:6). Bradford, a martyr, still subscribes himself
    <i>a sinner</i>. &quot;If I be righteous—yet will I not lift up my head&quot; (Job 
    10:15)—like the violet which is a sweet flower—but hangs down the head.</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">Answer 2: A humble soul thinks better of others than of 
    himself.</b></font> &quot;Let each esteem others better than themselves&quot; (Phil. 
    2:3). A humble man values others at a higher rate than himself, and the 
    reason is because he can see his own heart better than he can another's. He 
    sees his own corruption and thinks surely it is not so with others; their <i>
    graces </i>are not so weak as his; their <i>corruptions </i>are not so 
    strong. &quot;Surely&quot;, he thinks, &quot;they have better hearts than I.&quot; A humble 
    Christian studies <i>his own infirmities,</i> and <i>another's excellences
    </i>and that makes him put a higher value upon others than himself. &quot;Surely 
    I am more brutish than any man&quot; (Proverbs 30:2). And Paul, though he was the 
    chief of the apostles, still calls himself &quot;less than the least of all 
    saints&quot; (Eph. 3:8).</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">Answer 3: A humble soul has a low esteem of his duties.</b></font> 
    Pride is apt to breed in our <i>holy things</i>, as the worm breeds in the
    <i>sweetest fruit, </i>and froth comes from the most tasty wine. A humble 
    person bemoans not only his sins—but also his duties. When he has prayed and 
    wept, &quot;Alas,&quot; he says, &quot;how little I have done! God might damn me for all 
    this!&quot; He says, like good Nehemiah, &quot;Remember me, O my God, concerning this 
    also, and spare me&quot; (Neh. 13:22). &quot;Remember, Lord, how I have poured out my 
    soul—but spare me and pardon me.&quot; He sees that his best duties weigh too 
    light; therefore he desires that Christ's merits may be put into the scales. 
    The humble saint blushes when he looks at his copy. He sees he cannot write 
    evenly, nor without blotting. This humbles him to think that his best duties 
    run to seed. He drops <i>poison </i>upon his <i>sacrifice</i>. &quot;Oh,&quot; he 
    says, &quot;I dare not say I have prayed or wept; those which I write down as 
    duties, God might write down as sins!&quot;</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">Answer 4: A humble man is always giving bills of 
    indictment against himself. </b></font>He complains, not of his <i>poor 
    circumstances</i>—but of his <i>poor heart!</i> &quot;Oh, this evil heart of 
    unbelief!&quot; &quot;Lord,&quot; says Hooper, &quot;I am hell—but you are heaven.&quot; A hypocrite 
    is forever telling how good he is. A humble soul is forever saying how bad 
    he is. Paul, that high-flown saint, was caught up into the third heaven—but 
    how this bird of paradise bemoans his corruptions! &quot;O wretched man that I 
    am!&quot; (Romans 7:24). Holy Bradford subscribes himself, &quot;the hard-hearted 
    sinner&quot;. The more <i>knowledge </i>a humble Christian has, the more he 
    complains of ignorance; the more <i>faith </i>a humble Christian has, the 
    more he bewails his unbelief.</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">Answer 5: A humble man will justify God in an afflicted 
    condition. </b></font>&quot;You are just in all that is brought upon us&quot; (Neh. 
    9:33). If men oppress and calumniate, the humble soul acknowledges God's 
    righteousness in the midst of severity: &quot;Lo, I have sinned&quot; (2 Sam. 24:17). 
    &quot;Lord, my pride, my barrenness, my worldliness have been the procuring cause 
    of all these judgments.&quot; When <i>clouds </i>are around about God—yet 
    &quot;righteousness is the habitation of his throne&quot; (Psalm 97:2).</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">Answer 6: A humble soul is a Christ-magnifier</b></font> 
    (Phil. 1:20). He gives the glory of all his actions to Christ and free 
    grace. King Canute took the crown off his own head and set it upon a 
    crucifix. So a humble saint takes the crown of honor from his own head and 
    sets it upon Christ's. And the reason is the love that he bears to Christ. 
    Love can part with anything to the object loved. Isaac loved Rebekah and he 
    gave away his jewels to her (Gen. 24:53). The humble saint loves Christ 
    entirely, therefore can part with anything to him. He gives away to Christ 
    the honor and praise of all he does. &quot;Let Christ wear those jewels!&quot;</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">Answer 7: A humble soul is willing to take a reproof for 
    sin.</b></font> A wicked man is too high to stoop to a reproof. The prophet 
    Micaiah told King Ahab of his sin, and the King said, &quot;I hate him!&quot; (1 Kings 
    22:8). Reproof to a proud man is like pouring water on lime, which grows the 
    hotter. A gracious soul loves the one who reproves: &quot;rebuke a wise man, and 
    he will love you&quot; (Proverbs 9:8). The humble-spirited Christian can bear the 
    reproach of an <i>enemy, </i>and the reproof of a <i>friend</i>.</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">Answer 8: A humble man is willing to have his name and 
    gifts eclipsed, so that God's glory may be increased.</b></font> He is 
    content to be outshone by others in gifts and esteem, so that the crown of 
    Christ may shine the brighter. This is the humble man's motto: &quot;Let me 
    decrease; let Christ increase.&quot; It is his desire that Christ should be 
    exalted, and if this is effected, whoever is the instrument, he rejoices. 
    &quot;some preach Christ of envy&quot; (Phil. 1:15). They preached to take away some 
    of Paul's hearers. &quot;Well,&quot; says he, &quot;Christ is preached; and I therein do 
    rejoice&quot; (v.18). A humble Christian is content to be laid aside, if God has 
    any other tools to work with which may bring him more glory.</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">Answer 9: A humble saint is content with that condition 
    which God sees is best for him. </b></font>A proud man complains that he has 
    no more; a humble man wonders that he has so much: &quot;I am not worthy of the 
    least of all your mercies!&quot; (Gen. 32:10). When the heart lies low, it can 
    stoop to a low condition. A Christian looking at his sins wonders that 
    things are no worse with him. He says that his mercies are greater than he 
    deserves. He knows that the worst piece which God carves for him, is better 
    than he deserves; therefore he takes it thankfully upon his knees.</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">Answer 10: A humble Christian will stoop to the lowest 
    person and the lowest office</b></font>; he will visit the poorest member of 
    Christ. Lazarus' sores are more precious to him than Dives' royal robes. He 
    does not say, &quot;Stand aside, come not near to me, for I am holier than you&quot; 
    (Isaiah 65:5)—but &quot;condescends to men of low estate&quot; (Romans 12:16).</p>
    <font COLOR="#0000ff"><b>
    <p align="justify">Use 1:</b></font> If humility is the inseparable 
    character of a godly man, let us test our hearts by this touchstone. Are we 
    humble? Alas, where does their godliness appear—who are swollen with pride 
    and ready to burst? But though men are proud, they will not confess it. This<i> 
    bastard of pride </i>is born—but none are willing to <i>father </i>it. 
    Therefore let me ask a few questions and let conscience answer:</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">1. Are not those proud, who are given to boasting? </b>
    </font>&quot;Your boasting is not good.&quot; (1 Corinthians 5:6). </p>
    <p align="justify">(1) Many are proud of their <b>riches</b>. Their hearts 
    swell with their estates. Bernard calls pride the rich man's cousin. &quot;Your 
    heart has become proud because of your wealth.&quot; (Ezek. 28:5). </p>
    <p align="justify">(2) Many are proud of their <b>apparel</b>. They dress 
    themselves in such fashions as to make the devil fall in love with them. 
    Painted faces, gaudy attire, naked breasts, what are these, but the banners 
    which sinful pride displays? </p>
    <p align="justify">(3) Many are proud of their <b>beauty</b>. The body is 
    but dust and blood kneaded together. Solomon says, &quot;Beauty is vain&quot; 
    (Proverbs 31:30). Yet some are so vain as to be proud of vanity! </p>
    <p align="justify">(4) Many are proud of their <b>gifts</b> and <b>abilities</b>. 
    These trappings and ornaments do not approve them in God's eyes. An <i>angel
    </i>is a creature of great abilities; but take away humility from an 
    angel—and he is a devil!</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">2. Are not those who have a high opinion of their own 
    excellences proud?</b></font> Those who look at themselves in the magnifying 
    mirror of self-love, appear in their own eyes better than they are. Simon 
    Magus boasted that he was some great one (Acts 8:9). Alexander felt the need 
    to be the son of <i>Jupiter </i>and of the race of the gods. Sapor, King of 
    Persia, styles himself &quot;Brother of the Sun and Moon&quot;. I have read of a pope 
    who trod upon the neck of Frederick the Emperor and as a cloak for his pride 
    cited that text, &quot;You shall tread upon the lion, and the dragon shall you 
    trample under feet&quot; (Psalm. 91:13). <b>There is no idol like self; the proud 
    man bows down to this idol.</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000">
    <p align="justify">3. Are not those who despise others proud? </font></b>
    &quot;The Pharisees trusted in themselves, that they were righteous, and despised 
    others&quot; (Luke 18:9). The Chinese people say that Europe has one eye and they 
    have two, and all the rest of the world is blind. A proud man looks upon 
    others with such an eye of scorn, as Goliath did upon David: &quot;when the 
    Philistine looked about, and saw David, he disdained him&quot; (1 Sam. 17:42). 
    Those who stand upon the pinnacle of pride, look upon other men as no bigger 
    than crows.</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">4. Are not those who trumpet their own praise proud?</b></font> 
    &quot;Theudas rose up, <i>claiming </i>to be somebody&quot; (Acts 5:36). A proud man 
    is the herald of his own good deeds; he blazes his own fame, and therein 
    lies his vice, to paint his own virtue.</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">5. Are not those proud, who take the glory due to God, to 
    themselves?</b></font> &quot;Is not this great Babylon, which<b> I</b> have 
    built?&quot; (Dan. 4:30). So says the proud man, &quot;Are not these the prayers I 
    have made? Are not these the works of charity I have done?&quot; When Herod had 
    made an oration and the people cried him up for a god (Acts 12:22), he was 
    well content to have that honor done to him.<i> Pride is the greatest 
    sacrilege; it robs God of his glory!</p>
    </i><font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">6. Are not those who are never pleased with their 
    condition proud? </b></font>They speak harshly of God, charging his care and 
    wisdom, as if he had dealt badly with them. God himself cannot please a 
    proud man. He is forever finding fault, and flying in the face of heaven.</p>
    <p align="justify">Oh, let us search if there is any of this <i>leaven of 
    pride</i> in us. Man is naturally a proud piece of flesh. This sin of pride 
    runs in the blood. Our first parents fell by their pride. They aspired to 
    deity. There are the seeds of this sin of pride in the best—but the godly do 
    not allow themselves in it. They strive to kill this weed, by mortification. 
    But certainly where this sin reigns and prevails, it cannot stand with 
    grace. You may as well call him who lacks wisdom, <i>a prudent man</i>; as 
    him who lacks humility, <i>a godly man</i>.</p>
    <font COLOR="#0000ff"><b>
    <p align="justify">Use 2:</b></font> Strive for this characteristic: be 
    humble. It is an apostolic exhortation, &quot;Clothe yourselves with humility 
    toward one another, because, &quot;God opposes the proud but gives grace to the 
    humble.&quot; (1 Pet. 5:5). Put humility on as an embroidered robe. It is better 
    to lack anything, rather than humility. It is better to lack gifts rather 
    than humility. No, it is better to lack &quot;the comforts of the Spirit&quot; rather 
    than lack humility. &quot;What does the Lord require of you—but to walk humbly 
    with your God?&quot; (Mic. 6:8).</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">1. The more value any man has, the more humble he is. </b>
    </font>Feathers fly up—but gold descends! The golden saint descends in 
    humility. Some of the ancients have compared humility to the Celidonian 
    stone, which is little for substance—but of rare virtue.</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">2. God loves a humble soul.</b></font> It is not our high 
    birth—but our humble hearts, which God delights in. A humble spirit is in 
    God's view: &quot;to this man will I look, even to him that is poor and of a 
    contrite spirit&quot; (Isaiah 66:2). A humble heart is God's palace! &quot;For this is 
    what the high and lofty One says—he who lives forever, whose name is holy—I 
    live in a high and holy place, but also with him who is contrite and lowly 
    in spirit, to revive the spirit of the lowly and to revive the heart of the 
    contrite.&quot; (Isaiah 57:15). Great personages, besides their houses of state, 
    have lesser houses which upon occasion they retreat to. Besides God's house 
    of state in heaven, he has the humble soul for his retiring house, where he 
    takes up his rest, and solaces himself. Let Italy boast that it is, for 
    pleasure, the garden of the world. A humble heart glories in this, that it 
    is the presence chamber of the great and glorious King!</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">3. The times we live in are humbling.</b></font> The Lord 
    seems to say to us now, as he did to Israel, &quot;Remove your jewelry and 
    ornaments until I decide what to do with you.&quot; (Exod. 33:5). &quot;My displeasure 
    is breaking forth—I have eclipsed the light of the sanctuary, I have stained 
    the waters with blood, I have shot the arrow of pestilence—therefore lay 
    down your pride—&quot;Remove your jewelry and ornaments!&quot; Woe to those who lift 
    themselves up, when God is casting them down. When should people be 
    humble—if not when under the rod? &quot;Humble yourselves under the mighty hand 
    of God&quot; (1 Pet. 5:6). When God afflicts his people, and cuts them short in 
    their privileges, it is time then to &quot;sit in sackcloth—and sit in the dust&quot; 
    (Job 16:15).</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">4. What a horrid sin pride is! </b></font>Chrysostom 
    calls it &quot;the mother of hell&quot;. Pride is a complicated evil, as Aristotle 
    said. Justice encompasses all virtue in itself; so pride encompasses all 
    vice. Pride is a spiritual drunkenness; it flies up like wine into the brain 
    and intoxicates it. Pride is idolatry; a proud man is a self-worshiper. 
    Pride is revenge; Haman plotted Mordecai's death because he would not bow 
    the knee. How odious is this sin to God! &quot;Everyone who is proud in heart, is 
    an abomination to the Lord!&quot; (Proverbs 16:5). &quot;I hate pride and arrogance!&quot; 
    (Proverbs 8:13) </p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">5. The mischief of pride.</b></font> It is the breakneck 
    of souls! &quot;As surely as I live,&quot; says the Lord Almighty, the God of Israel, 
    &quot;Moab and Ammon will be destroyed as completely as Sodom and Gomorrah. Their 
    land will become a place of stinging nettles, salt pits, and eternal 
    desolation. They will receive the wages of their pride!&quot; (Zeph. 2:9,10). 
    &quot;Doves&quot;, says Pliny, &quot;take a pride in their feathers, and in their flying 
    high; at last they fly so high that they are a prey to the hawk.&quot; Men fly so 
    high in pride that at last they are a prey to the devil, the prince of the 
    air.</p>

    All give respect to the humble: &quot;Before honor is humility&quot; (Proverbs 15:33).</p>
    <i>
    <p align="justify">Question: </i>What means may we use to be humble?</p>
    <i>
    <p align="justify">Answer</i> 1: Let us set before us the golden pattern of 
    Christ. His degree is <i>'doctorate in humility'</i>. &quot;But made himself of 
    no reputation, and was made in the likeness of men&quot; (Phil. 2:7). O what 
    abasement it was for the Son of God to take our flesh! No, that Christ 
    should take our nature when it was in disgrace, being stained with sin—this 
    was the wonder of humility. <i>Look at a humble Savior—and let the plumes of 
    pride fall off!</p>
    <p align="justify">Answer</i> 2: Study God's immensity and purity; a sight 
    of glory humbles. Elijah wrapped his face in a mantle when God's glory 
    passed before him (1 Kings 19:13). The stars vanish when the sun appears.</p>
    <i>
    <p align="justify">Answer</i> 3: Let us study ourselves. </p>
    <p align="justify">First, our <b>dark </b>side. By looking at our faces in 
    the mirror of the Word, we see our <i>spots</i>. What a world of sin swarms 
    in us! We may say with Bernard, &quot;Lord, I am nothing but sin or sterility, 
    either sinfulness or barrenness.&quot;</p>
    <p align="justify">Secondly, our light side. Is there any <b>good </b>in us?</p>
    <p align="justify">1. <i>How disproportionate is our good—compared to the 
    means of grace we have enjoyed!</i> There is still something lacking in our 
    faith (1 Thess. 3:10). O Christian, do not be proud of what you have—but be 
    humble for what you lack.</p>
    <p align="justify">2. <i>The grace we have is not of our own growth.</i> We 
    are indebted to Christ and free grace for it. As he said of that axe which 
    fell in the water, &quot;Alas, master, for it was <i>borrowed</i>&quot; (2 Kings 6:5), 
    so I may say of all the good and excellence in us, &quot;It is borrowed&quot;. Would 
    it not be folly to be proud of a ring that is loaned to us? &quot;For who makes 
    you to differ from another? And what have you that you did not receive?&quot; (1 
    Cor. 4:7). The <i>moon </i>has no cause to be proud of her light—as she 
    borrows it from the sun.</p>
    <p align="justify">3. <i>How far short we come of others!</i> Perhaps other 
    Christians are giants in grace; they are in Christ not only <i>before </i>
    us—but <i>above </i>us. We are but like the <i>foot </i>in Christ's body; 
    they are like the <i>eye</i>.</p>
    <p align="justify">4. <i>Our beauty is spotted</i>. The church is said to be 
    &quot;fair as the moon&quot; (Song 6:10), which when it shines brightest, has a dark 
    spot in it. Faith is mixed with unbelief. A Christian has that in his very 
    grace, which may humble him.</p>
    <p align="justify">5. <i>If we would be humble, let us contemplate our 
    mortality</i>. Shall dust exalt itself? The thoughts of the grave should 
    bury our pride. They say that when there is a <i>swelling </i>in the body, 
    the hand of a dead man stroking that part cures the swelling. The serious 
    meditation of death is enough to cure the swelling of pride.</p>

    </b></font></h2>
    <p align="justify">&quot;Let everyone who is godly pray to You.&quot; Psalm 32:6 </p>
    <p align="justify">As soon as <i>grace </i>is poured in—<i>prayer </i>is 
    poured out! &quot;But I give myself unto prayer&quot; (Psalm 109:4). In the Hebrew it 
    is, &quot;but I prayer&quot;. Prayer and I are all one. Prayer is the soul's communion 
    with heaven. God comes down to us by his Spirit—and we go up to him by 
    prayer. Caligula placed his idols<i>—as whispering in Jupiter's ear</i>. <b>
    Prayer is a whispering in God's ear! </b>A godly man cannot live without 
    prayer. A man cannot live unless he takes his breath, nor can the soul, 
    unless it breathes forth its desires to God. As soon as the babe of grace is 
    born, it cries. No sooner was Paul converted than &quot;behold, he prays!&quot; (Acts 
    9:11). No doubt he prayed before, being a Pharisee—but it was either <i>
    superficially </i>or <i>superstitiously</i>. But when the work of grace had 
    been done in his soul, behold, now he <i>prays! </p>
    </i>
    <p align="justify">A godly man is on the mount of prayer every day. He 
    begins the day with prayer. Before he opens his <i>shop</i>—he opens his <i>
    heart </i>to God! We burn sweet incense in our houses; a godly man's house 
    is &quot;a house of incense&quot;; he airs it with the incense of prayer. He engages 
    in no business without seeking God. A godly man consults God in everything; 
    he asks God's permission and his blessing. The Greeks asked counsel at their 
    oracles; just so, a godly man enquires at the divine oracle (Gen. 24:12; 1 
    Sam. 23:3,4). A true saint continually shoots up his heart to heaven, by 
    sacred prayers.</p>

    <p align="justify">Question: What is it to make a SPIRITUAL PRAYER?</p>
    </b></font><font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">Answer 1: When we pray with KNOWLEDGE.</b></font> Under 
    the law, Aaron was to &quot;light the lamps&quot; when he burned the incense on the 
    altar (Exod. 30:7). Incense typified prayer, and the lighting of the lamps 
    typified knowledge. When the incense of prayer burns, the lamp of knowledge 
    must be lit: &quot;I will pray with the understanding&quot; (1 Cor. 14:15). We must 
    know the majesty and holiness of God, so that we may be deeply affected with 
    reverence when we come before him. We must put up such petitions as are 
    exactly adequate and agreeable to God's will. &quot;Be not rash with your mouth, 
    to utter anything before God&quot; (Eccles. 5:2). The Lord would not have the <i>
    blind </i>offered to him (Mal. 1:8). How can we pray with affection when we 
    do not pray with judgment? The Papists pray in an unknown tongue. Christ may 
    reply to them as he did to the mother of Zebedee's children, &quot;You know not 
    what you ask&quot; (Matt. 20:22). He who prays he knows not how, shall be heard 
    he knows not when.</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">Answer 2: A spiritual prayer is when the HEART and spirit 
    pray.</b></font> There are not only words but desires. It is excellent when 
    a man can say, &quot;Lord, my heart prays.&quot; Hannah &quot;prayed in her heart&quot; (1 Sam. 
    1:13). The sound of a trumpet comes from within—and the excellent music of 
    prayer comes from within the heart. If the heart does not accompany duty—it 
    is <i>speaking</i>, not <i>praying</i>.</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">Answer 3: A spiritual prayer is a FERVENT prayer. </b>
    </font>&quot;The effectual <i>fervent </i>prayer . . . avails much&quot; (Jas. 5:16). 
    The heart, like the mainspring, should carry the affections in a most 
    zealous and rapid manner<i>. Fervency </i>is the wing of prayer by which it 
    ascends to heaven. Prayer is expressed by sighs and groans (Romans 8:26). It 
    is not so much the <i>gifts </i>of the Spirit—as the <i>groans </i>of the 
    Spirit, which God likes. Prayer is called a &quot;wrestling&quot; (Gen. 32:24) and a 
    &quot;pouring out of the soul&quot; (1 Sam. 1:15). Prayer is compared to incense 
    (Psalm 141:2). Incense without fire makes no sweet smell. Prayer without 
    fervency is like incense without fire. Christ prayed with &quot;Strong crying and 
    tears&quot; (Heb. 5:7); crying prayer prevails. When the heart is inflamed in 
    prayer, a Christian is carried as it were in a fiery chariot up to heaven.</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">Answer 4: A spiritual prayer is such as comes from a 
    BROKEN heart.</b></font> &quot;The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit&quot; (Psalm 
    51:17). The incense was to be <i>beaten</i>, to typify the breaking of the 
    heart in prayer. It is not the eloquent tongue—but the melting heart—which 
    God accepts. </p>
    <p align="justify">Moses said to the Lord, &quot;I am not <i>eloquent</i>.&quot; &quot;Oh,&quot; 
    says a Christian, &quot;I cannot pray like others.&quot; But can you weep and sigh? 
    Does your soul melt out at your eyes? God accepts broken expressions, when 
    they come from broken hearts. I have read of a plant which bears no 
    fruit—but it weeps forth a kind of gum which is very costly. So, though you 
    do not flourish with those gifts and expressions like others—yet if you can 
    weep forth tears from a contrite heart, these are exceedingly precious to 
    God, and he will put them in his bottle. Jacob wept in prayer and had &quot;power 
    over the angel&quot; (Hos. 12:4).</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">Answer 5: A spiritual prayer is a BELIEVING prayer.</b></font> 
    &quot;Whatever you shall ask in prayer, believing, you shall receive&quot; (Matt. 
    21:22). The reason why so many prayers suffer shipwreck, is because they 
    split against the <i>rock of unbelief</i>. Praying without faith, is like 
    shooting without bullets. When faith takes prayer by the hand, then we draw 
    near to God. We should come to God in prayer like the leper: &quot;Lord, if you 
    will, you can make me clean&quot; (Matt. 8:2). It is a disparagement to deity to 
    have such a whisper in the heart, that &quot;God's ear is heavy and cannot hear&quot; 
    (Isaiah 59:1). What is said of the people of Israel may be applied to 
    prayer—&quot;They could not enter in, because of unbelief&quot; (Heb. 3:19).</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">Answer 6: A spiritual prayer is a HOLY prayer.</b></font> 
    &quot;Lift up holy hands in prayer&quot; (1 Tim. 2:8). Prayer must be offered on <i>
    the altar of a pure heart</i>. Sin lived in—makes the heart hard, and God's 
    ear deaf. Sin stops the mouth of prayer. Sin does what the thief does to the 
    traveler—puts a gag in his mouth so that he cannot speak. Sin poisons and 
    infests prayer. A wicked man's prayer carries the plague, and will God come 
    near him? The loadstone loses its virtue when it is spread with garlic; so 
    does prayer when it is polluted with sin. &quot;If I regard iniquity in my heart, 
    the Lord will not hear me&quot; (Psalm 66:18). It is foolish to pray against sin 
    and then to sin against prayer. A spiritual prayer, like the spirits of 
    wine, must be refined and taken off the lees and dregs of sin: &quot;that they 
    may offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness&quot; (Mal. 3:3). If the 
    heart is holy—this altar will sanctify the gift.</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">Answer 7: A spiritual prayer is a HUMBLE prayer.</b></font> 
    &quot;Lord, you have heard the desire of the humble&quot; (Psalm 10:17). Prayer is the 
    asking of an alms, which requires humility. &quot;The publican, standing afar 
    off, would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven—but smote upon his 
    breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner&quot; (Luke 18:13). God's 
    incomprehensible glory may even amaze us and strike a holy consternation 
    into us, when we approach near to him: &quot;O my God, I blush to lift up my face 
    to you&quot; (Ezra 9:6). It is lovely to see a <i>poor nothing </i>lie prostrate 
    at the feet of its Maker. &quot;Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto 
    the Lord—who am but dust and ashes&quot; (Gen. 18:27). The lower the <i>heart </i>
    descends—the higher the <i>prayer </i>ascends.</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">Answer 8: A spiritual prayer is when we pray in the NAME 
    OF CHRIST.</b></font> To pray in the name of Christ is not only to name 
    Christ in prayer—but to pray in the hope and confidence of Christ's 
    mediation. As a child claims his estate in the right of his father who 
    purchased it, so we come for mercy in the name of Christ, who has purchased 
    it for us in his blood. Unless we pray thus, we do not pray at all; no, we 
    rather provoke God. As it was with Uzziah, when he wanted to offer incense 
    without a priest, God was angry and struck him with leprosy (2 Chron. 
    26:16-19). So when we do not come in Christ's name in prayer, we offer up 
    incense without a priest, and what can we expect but to meet with wrath?</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">Answer 9: A spiritual prayer is when we pray out of LOVE 
    to prayer.</b></font> A wicked man may pray—but he does not <i>love </i>
    prayer. &quot;Will he delight himself in the Almighty?&quot; (Job 27:10). A godly man 
    is carried on the wings of delight. He is never so well, as when he is 
    praying. He is not forced with <i>fear</i>—but fired with <i>love</i>. &quot;I 
    will make them joyful in my house of prayer&quot; (Isaiah 56:7).</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">Answer 10: A spiritual prayer is when we have SPIRITUAL 
    GOALS in prayer.</b></font> There is a vast difference between a spiritual 
    prayer and a carnal desire. The goals of a hypocrite are selfish and carnal. 
    He looks asquint in prayer. It is not the sense of his spiritual needs which 
    moves him—but rather his lusts. &quot;You ask amiss, that you may consume it upon 
    your lusts&quot; (Jas. 4:3). The sinner prays more for <i>food, </i>than for <i>
    grace</i>. This, God does not interpret as <i>praying—</i>but as <i>howling</i>: 
    &quot;They do not cry out to me from their hearts but <i>howl </i>upon their 
    beds. They gather together for grain and new wine but turn away from me. &quot; (Hos. 
    7:14).</p>
    <p align="justify">Prayers which lack a good <i>aim</i>—lack a good <i>
    answer</i>. A godly man has spiritual goals in prayer. He sends out his 
    prayer as a merchant sends out his ship, so that he may have large returns 
    of spiritual blessings. His design in prayer is that his heart may be more 
    holy and that he may have more communion with God. A godly man engages in 
    the <i>trade of prayer—</i>so that he may increase the<i> stock of grace</i>.</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">Answer 11: A spiritual prayer is accompanied with the use 
    of MEANS.</b></font> There must be <i>works</i>—as well as prayer. When 
    Hezekiah was sick he did not only pray for recovery—but he &quot;prepared a 
    poultice of figs and applies it to the boil&quot; (Isaiah 38:21). Thus it is in 
    the case of the soul when we pray against sin and avoid temptations. When we 
    pray for grace and use opportunities to the full, this is <i>laying a fig on 
    the boil </i>which will make us recover. To pray for holiness and neglect 
    the means—is like winding up the clock and taking off the weights.</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">Answer 12: A spiritual prayer is that which leaves a 
    SPIRITUAL MOOD behind upon the heart. </b></font>A Christian is better after 
    prayer. He has gained more strength over sin, as a man by exercise gets 
    strength. The heart after prayer keeps a tincture of holiness, as the vessel 
    favors and relishes of the wine which is put into it. Having been with God 
    on the mount—Moses' face shone. So, having been on the mount of prayer—our
    <i>graces </i>shine and our <i>lives </i>shine. This is the sign of a godly 
    man—he prays in the Spirit. This is the right kind of praying. The <i>gift
    </i>of prayer is ordinary—like culinary fire. But <i>spiritual </i>prayer is 
    more rare and excellent—like elemental fire which comes from heaven.</p>
    <font COLOR="#0000ff"><b>
    <p align="justify">Use 1:</b></font> Is a godly man of a praying spirit? 
    Then this excludes from being godly:</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">1. Those who do not pray at all. </b></font>Their houses 
    are unhallowed houses. It is made the note of a reprobate that &quot;he does not 
    call upon God&quot; (Psalm 14:4). Does that poor creature who never asks for 
    alms, think that he will receive any? Do those who never seek mercy from 
    God, think that they will receive it? Truly, then God should befriend them 
    more than he did his own Son. &quot;He offered up prayers and supplications with 
    strong cries&quot; (Heb. 5:7). None of God's children are <i>tongue-tied</i>. 
    &quot;Because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your 
    hearts, crying, <i>Abba, Father</i>&quot; (Gal. 4:6). Creatures by the instinct 
    of nature cry to God: &quot;the young ravens which cry&quot; (Psalm 147:9). &quot;The lions 
    seek their meat from God&quot; (Psalm 104:21). Not to cry to God, is worse than 
    brutish.</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">2. Others pray—but it is seldom</b></font>. Like that 
    profane atheist of whom Heylin speaks, who told God that <i>&quot;he was no 
    common beggar</i>; he had never troubled him before and if he would hear him 
    now, he would never trouble him again.&quot;</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">3. Others pray—but not &quot;in the Holy Spirit&quot; </b></font>
    (Jude 20). They are more like <i>parrots</i>, than <i>weeping doves</i>. 
    Their hearts do not melt in prayer: they exercise their tongues more than 
    their hearts and affections.</p>
    <font COLOR="#0000ff"><b>
    <p align="justify">Use 2: </b></font>As you would prove the new birth, cry 
    &quot;Abba, Father&quot;; be men of prayer. Pray at least twice a day. In the temple 
    there was the <i>morning </i>and <i>evening </i>sacrifice. Daniel prayed 
    three times a day. No, he so loved prayer that he would not neglect prayer 
    to save his life (Dan. 6:10). Luther spent three hours every day in prayer.</p>
    <i>
    <p align="justify">Objection:</i> But what need is there of prayer, when God 
    has made so many promises of blessings?</p>
    <i>
    <p align="justify">Answer:</i> Prayer is the condition annexed to the 
    promise. Promises turn upon <i>the hinge of prayer</i>: &quot;I will yet for this 
    be inquired of by the house of Israel&quot; (Ezek. 36:37). A king promises a 
    pardon—but it must be sued for. David had a promise that God would build him 
    a house—but he sues for the promise by prayer (2 Sam. 7:25). Christ himself 
    had all the promises made sure to him—yet he prayed and spent whole nights 
    in prayer.</p>
    <p align="justify">Therefore if you would be counted godly, be given to 
    prayer. Prayer sanctifies your mercies (1 Tim. 4:5). Prayer weeds out sin. 
    Prayer waters grace.</p>
    <p align="justify">That I may encourage Christians and hold up their heads 
    in prayer, as Aaron and Hur held up Moses&quot; hands (Exod. 17:12), let me 
    propound these few considerations:</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">1. Prayer is a seed sown in God's ear.</b></font> Other 
    seed sown in the ground may be picked up by the birds—but this seed 
    (especially if watered with tears) is too precious to lose.</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">2. Consider the power of prayer. </b></font>The apostle, 
    having set out the whole armor of a Christian, brings in prayer as the chief 
    part (Eph. 6:18). Without this (says Zanchius), all the rest are of little 
    value. By prayer, Moses divided the Red Sea. . By prayer, Joshua stopped the 
    course of the sun and made it stand still (Josh. 10: 13). More, prayer made 
    the <i>Sun of righteousness</i> stand still: &quot;and Jesus stood still&quot; (Luke 
    18:40). Prayer is the entrance to all blessings, spiritual and temporal. 
    Prayer has a power in it to destroy the insolent enemies of the church. We 
    read that &quot;the two witnesses&quot; have a flame on their lips—fire proceeds out 
    of their mouths which devours their enemies (Rev. 11:3,5). This fire is 
    certainly to be interpreted of their prayers. David prayed, &quot;Lord, turn the 
    counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness&quot; (2 Sam. 15:31). This prayer made 
    Ahithophel hang himself. Moses' prayer against Amalek, did more than 
    Joshua's sword. Prayer has a kind of <i>omnipotency </i>in it; it has raised 
    the dead, overcome angels, cast out devils. It has influence upon God 
    himself (Exod. 32:10). Jacob's prayer held God: &quot;I will not let you go, 
    except you bless me&quot; (Gen. 32:26). Prayer finds God free—but leaves him 
    bound.</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">3. Jesus Christ prays our prayers over again. </b></font>
    He takes the dross out, and presents nothing but pure gold to his Father. 
    Christ mingles his sweet fragrances, with the prayers of the saints (Rev. 
    5:8). Think of the dignity of his person—he is God; and the sweetness of his 
    relationship—he is a Son. Oh then, what encouragement there is here for us 
    to pray! Our prayers are put in the hands of a Mediator. Though, as they 
    come from us, they are weak and imperfect—yet as they come from Christ, they 
    are mighty and powerful.</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">4. The sweet promises which God has made to prayer.</b></font> 
    &quot;He will be very gracious unto you at the voice of your cry&quot; (Isaiah 30:19). 
    &quot;Then shall you go and pray unto me, and I will hearken unto you. And you 
    shall seek me, and find me, when you shall search for me with all your 
    heart&quot; (Jer. 29:12,13); and &quot;before they call, I will answer; and while they 
    are yet speaking, I will hear&quot; (Isaiah 65:24). These promises keep the head 
    of prayer above water. God is bound with his own promises, as Samson was 
    bound with his own hair.</p>
    <p align="justify">Let us, then, close ranks and with our Savior pray yet 
    more earnestly (Luke 22:44). Let us be importunate suitors, and resolve with 
    Bernard that <i>we will not come away from God without God</i>. Prayer is a
    <i>bomb </i>which bursts heaven's gates open.</p>
    <i>
    <p align="justify">Question:</i> How shall we go about praying aright?</p>
    <i>
    <p align="justify">Answer:</i> Implore the Spirit of God: &quot;praying in the 
    Holy Spirit&quot; (Jude 20). The Holy Spirit both <i>originates </i>prayer and <i>
    inflames </i>it. God understands no other language, but that of his Spirit. 
    Pray <i>for </i>the Holy Spirit that you may pray <i>in </i>the Holy Spirit.</p>

    <p align="justify">&quot;Behold an Israelite indeed, in whose spirit there is no 
    deceit&quot; (John 1:47). The word for sincere, <i>haplous</i>, signifies 
    &quot;without pleats and folds&quot;. A godly man is plain-hearted, having no subtle

    <p align="justify">Answer 1: The godly man is what he seems to be. </b>
    </font>He is <i>a Jew inwardly </i>(Romans 2:29). Grace runs through his 
    heart, as silver through the veins of the earth. The hypocrite is not what 
    he seems. A picture is like a man—but it lacks breath. The hypocrite is a

    <p align="justify">Answer 2: The godly man strives to approve himself to God 
    in everything.</b></font> &quot;We labor, that, whether present or absent, we may 
    be accepted of him&quot; (2 Cor. 5:9). It is better to have <i>God </i>approve, 
    than the <i>world </i>applaud. Those who ran in the Olympic race strove to 
    have the approval of the judge and umpire of the race. There is a time 
    coming shortly, when a smile from God's face will be infinitely better than 
    all the applause of men. How sweet that word will be, &quot;Well done, good and 
    faithful servant!&quot; (Matt. 25:21). A godly man is ambitious of <i>God's </i>
    testimonial letters. The hypocrite desires the praise of <i>men. </i>Saul 
    was for the approval of the people (1 Sam. 15:30) A godly man approves his 
    heart to God, who is both the spectator and the judge.</p>

    sins. </b></font>&quot;I acknowledged my sin unto you, and my iniquity have I not 
    hid&quot; (Psalm 32:5). The hypocrite veils and cloaks his sin. He does not <i>
    cut off </i>his sin but <i>conceals </i>it. Like a patient who has some 
    loathsome disease in his body, he will rather die than reveal his disease. 
    But a godly man's sincerity is seen in this—he will confess and shame 
    himself for sin: &quot;Lo, I have sinned, and I have done wickedly&quot; (2 Sam. 
    24:17). No, a child of God will confess sin <i>in particular</i>. An unsound 
    Christian will confess sin <i>wholesale</i>, he will acknowledge he is a 
    sinner in general. Whereas David does, as it were, point with his finger to 
    the sore: &quot;I have done <i>this </i>evil&quot; (Psalm 51:4). He does not say, &quot;I 
    have done evil&quot;—but &quot;<i>this </i>evil&quot;. He points at his blood-guiltiness.</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">Answer 4: The godly man has blessed designs in all he 
    does.</b></font> He propounds this objective in every ordinance—that he may 
    have more acquaintance with God, and bring more glory to God. As the herb 
    heliotropium turns about according to the motion of the sun, so a godly 
    man's actions all move towards the glory of God. A godly man's praying and 
    worshiping, is so that he may honor God. Though he shoots short—yet he takes 
    correct aim. The hypocrite thinks of nothing but self-interest; the sails of 
    his mill move only when the <i>wind of self promotion </i>blows. He never 
    dives into the waters of the sanctuary—except to fetch up a piece of gold 
    from the bottom.</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">Answer 5: The godly man abhors deception.</b></font> His
    <i>heart </i>goes along with his <i>tongue</i>; he cannot both flatter and 
    hate; both commend and censure (Psalm 28:3). Love must be sincere&quot; (Romans 
    12:9). Insincere love is worse than hatred; counterfeiting of friendship is 
    no better than a lie (Psalm 78:36), for there is a pretense of that which is 
    not. Many are like Joab: &quot;He took Amasa by the beard to kiss him—and smote 
    him with his sword in the fifth rib, and he died&quot; (2 Sam. 20:9,10). 
    &quot;Horrible poisons lie hidden under sweet honey.&quot;</p>
    <p align="justify">There is a river in Spain where the fish seem to be of a 
    golden color—but take them out of the water and they are like other fish. 
    All is not gold that glitters; there are some who pretend much kindness—but 
    they are like great veins which have little blood. If you lean upon them, 
    they are like a leg out of joint. For my part I seriously question a man's 
    sincerity with God—if he flatters and lies to his friend. &quot;He who conceals 
    his hatred has lying lips&quot; (Proverbs 10:18). By all that has been said, we 
    may test whether we have this mark of a godly man—being sincere.</p>
    <p align="justify">Sincerity (as I conceive it) is not strictly a grace, but 
    rather <i>the ingredient in every grace. </i>Sincerity is that which 
    qualifies grace and without which grace is not true: &quot;Grace be with all 
    those who love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity&quot; (Eph. 6:24). Sincerity 
    qualifies our love; sincerity is to grace what the blood and spirits are to 
    the body. There can be no life without the blood, so there can be no grace 
    without sincerity.</p>
    <font COLOR="#0000ff"><b>
    <p align="justify">Use: </b></font>As we would be reputed godly, let us 
    strive for this characteristic of sincerity.</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">1. Sincerity renders us lovely in God's eyes.</b></font> 
    God says of the sincere soul, as of Zion, &quot;This is my rest forever: here 
    will I dwell; for I have desired it&quot; (Psalm 132:14). A sincere heart is 
    God's paradise of delight. &quot;Noah found grace in God's eyes.&quot; Why, what did 
    God see in Noah? He was girt with the girdle of sincerity (Gen. 6:9). Noah 
    was perfect in his generation. Truth resembles God, and when God sees a 
    sincere heart, he sees his own image, and he cannot choose but fall in love 
    with it: &quot;He who is upright in his way, is God's delight&quot; (Proverbs 11:20).</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">2. Sincerity makes our services find acceptance with God.</b></font> 
    The church of Philadelphia had only &quot;a little strength&quot;; her grace was weak, 
    her services slender; yet of all the churches Christ wrote to, he found the 
    least fault with her. What was the reason? Because she was most sincere: 
    &quot;You have kept fast my word, and have not denied my name&quot; (Rev. 3:8). Though 
    we cannot pay God all we owe—yet a little in current coin, is accepted. God 
    takes <i>sincerity </i>for full payment. A little gold, though rusty, is 
    better than tin, be it ever so bright. A little sincerity, though rusted 
    over with many infirmities, is of more value with God than all the glorious 
    flourishes of hypocrites.</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">3. Sincerity is our safety.</b></font> False hearts that 
    will step out of God's way and use carnal policy, when they think they are 
    most safe, are least secure. &quot;He who walks uprightly walks surely&quot; (Proverbs 
    10:9). A sincere Christian will do nothing but what the Word warrants, and 
    that is safe, as to the conscience. More, often the Lord takes care of the 
    outward safety of those who are upright in their way: &quot;I laid me down and 
    slept&quot; (Psalm 3:5). David was now beleaguered by enemies—yet God so encamped 
    about him by his providence, that he could sleep as securely as in a 
    garrison. &quot;The Lord sustained me.&quot; The only way to be <i>safe </i>is to be
    <i>sincere</i>.</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">4. Sincerity is gospel perfection.</b></font> &quot;Have you 
    considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a 
    perfect and an upright man?&quot; (Job 1:8). Though a Christian is full of 
    infirmities and, like a young child, weak and feeble—God still looks on him 
    as if he were completely righteous. Every true saint has the <i>Thummim of 
    perfection</i> on his breastplate.</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">5. Sincerity is what the devil attacks most.</b></font> 
    Satan's spite was not so much at Job's estate, as his integrity; he would 
    have wrested the shield of sincerity from him—but Job held that fast (Job 
    27:6). A thief does not fight for an empty purse—but for money. The devil 
    would have robbed Job of the jewel of a good conscience, and then he would 
    have been <i>poor Job </i>indeed. Satan does not oppose mere profession—but
    <i>sincerity</i>. Let men go to church and make glorious pretenses of 
    holiness. Satan does not oppose this; this does him no hurt—and them no 
    good! But if men desire to be sincerely pious, then Satan musters up all his 
    forces against them. Now what the devil most assaults—that we must strive 
    most to maintain. Sincerity is our fort royal, where our chief treasure 
    lies. This fort is most shot at, therefore let us be more careful to 
    preserve it. While a man keeps his castle, his castle will keep him. While 
    we keep sincerity, sincerity will keep us.</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">6. Sincerity is the beauty of a Christian.</b></font> 
    Wherein does the beauty of a diamond lie—but in this, that it is a true 
    diamond? If it is counterfeit, it is worth nothing. So wherein does the 
    beauty of a Christian lie—but in this, that he has truth in the inward parts 
    (Psalm 51:6)? Sincerity is a Christian's ensign of glory; it is both his 
    breastplate to defend him and his crown to adorn him.</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">7. See the vileness of hypocrisy.</b></font> The Lord 
    would have no <i>leaven </i>offered up in sacrifice; leaven typified <i>
    hypocrisy </i>(Luke 12:1). The hypocrite does the devil double service; 
    under the <i>mask of piety</i>, he can sin more and be less suspected: &quot;Woe 
    unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you devour widows' houses, 
    and for a pretense make long prayers&quot; (Matt. 23:14). Who would think that 
    those who pray for so many hours on end, would be guilty of extortion? Who 
    would suspect of false weights, the man who has the Bible so often in his 
    hand? Who would think that the one who seems to fear an oath, would slander? 
    Hypocrites are the worst sort of sinners; they reflect infinite dishonor 
    upon religion. Hypocrisy for the most part ends in scandal, and that brings 
    an evil report on the ways of God. One scandalous hypocrite makes the world 
    suspect that all professing Christians are like him. The hypocrite was born 
    to spite religion, and bring it into disrepute.</p>
    <p align="justify">The hypocrite is a liar. He worships God with his 
    knee—but the passions with his heart, like those who &quot;feared the Lord, and 
    served their own gods&quot; (2 Kings 17:33).</p>
    <p align="justify">The hypocrite is an impudent sinner. He knows his heart 
    is false—yet he goes on. Judas knew himself to be a hypocrite; he asks, 
    &quot;Master, is it I?&quot; Christ replies, &quot;You have said it&quot; (Matt. 26:25). Yet so 
    shameless was he as to persist in his falseness and betray Christ. All the 
    plagues and curses written in the Book of God are the hypocrite's portion! 
    Hell is his place of rendezvous (Matt. 24:51). Hypocrites are the chief 
    guests whom the devil expects, and he will make them as welcome as fire and 
    brimstone can make them!</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">8. If the heart is sincere, God will wink at many 
    failings. </b></font>&quot;He has not beheld iniquity in Jacob&quot; (Numb. 23:21). 
    God's love does not make him blind; he can see infirmities. But how does God 
    look at a believer's sins? Not with an eye of revenge—but of pity, as a 
    physician sees a disease in his patient—so as to heal him. God does not see 
    iniquity in Jacob—so as to destroy him—but to heal him! &quot;He kept on in his 
    willful ways. I have seen his ways, but I will heal him&quot; (Isaiah 57:17,18). 
    How much pride, vanity, passion, does the Lord pass by in his sincere ones! 
    He sees the <i>integrity</i>—and pardons the <i>infirmity</i>. How much God 
    overlooked in Asa! The &quot;high places were not removed&quot;—yet it is said, &quot;The 
    heart of Asa was <i>perfect </i>all his days&quot; (2 Chron. 15:17). We esteem a 
    picture, though it is not drawn<i> full length</i>. Just so, the graces of 
    God's people are not drawn to their full length! They have many scars and 
    spots—yet having something of God in sincerity, they shall find mercy. God 
    loves the sincere, and it is the nature of love to cover infirmity.</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">9. Nothing but sincerity will give us comfort in an hour 
    of trouble.</b></font> King Hezekiah thought he was dying—yet this revived 
    him, that his conscience drew up a certificate for him: &quot;Remember, O Lord, 
    how I have walked before you in truth . . . &quot; (Isaiah 38:3). Sincerity was 
    the best flower in his crown. What a golden shield this will be against 
    Satan! When he roars at us by his temptations, and sets our sins before us 
    on our death-bed, then we shall answer, &quot;It is true, Satan; these have been 
    our misdeeds—but we have bewailed them; if we have sinned, it was against 
    the bent and purpose of our heart.&quot; This will stop the devil's mouth and 
    make him retreat; therefore strive for this jewel of sincerity. &quot;If our 
    heart condemn us not, then have we confidence toward God&quot; (1 John 3:21). If 
    we are cleared at the petty sessions in our conscience, then we may be 
    confident we shall be acquitted at the great assizes on the day of judgment.</p>
    <p align="justify">&quot;Our conscience testifies that we have conducted 
    ourselves in the world, and especially in our relations with you—in the 
    holiness and <b>sincerity </b>that are from God.&quot; 2 Corinthians 1:12. &quot;Let 
    us draw near to God with a sincere heart.&quot; Hebrews 10:22.</p>

    <p align="justify">14. A godly man is a HEAVENLY man</p>
    </b></font></h2>
    <p align="justify">Heaven is in him—before he is in heaven! The Greek word 
    for saint, <i>hagios</i>, signifies a man taken away from the earth. A 
    person may live in one place—yet belong to another. He may live in Spain yet 
    be a citizen of England. So a godly man is a while in the world—but he 
    belongs to the Jerusalem above. That is the place to which he aspires. Every 
    day is <i>Ascension Day</i> with a believer. The saints are called &quot;stars&quot; 
    for their sublimity; they have gone above into the upper region: &quot;The way of 
    life is above, to the wise&quot; (Proverbs 15:24). A godly man is heavenly in six 
    ways:</p>
    <p align="justify">1. In his election.</p>
    <p align="justify">2. In his disposition.</p>
    <p align="justify">3. In his communication.</p>
    <p align="justify">4. In his actions.</p>
    <p align="justify">5. In his expectation.</p>
    <p align="justify">6. In his conduct.</p>
    <font COLOR="#0000ff"><b>
    <p align="justify">1. A godly man is heavenly in his CHOICES</p>
    </b></font>
    <p align="justify">He chooses heavenly objects. David chose to be a resident 
    in God's house (Psalm 84:10). A godly person chooses Christ and grace, 
    before the most illustrious things of this world. What a man chooses—that is 
    what he is. This choosing of God is best seen in a critical hour. When 
    Christ and the world come into competition, and we part with the world to 
    keep Christ and a good conscience, that is a sign we have chosen &quot;the better 
    part&quot; (Luke 10:42). Moses &quot;<i>chose </i>to be mistreated along with the 
    people of God, rather than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a short time.&quot; 
    Hebrews 11:25 </p>
    <font COLOR="#0000ff"><b>
    <p align="justify">2. A godly man is heavenly in his DISPOSITION</p>
    </b></font>
    <p align="justify">He sets his affections on things above (Col. 3:2). He 
    sends his heart to heaven before he gets there. He looks upon the world as 
    but a <i>beautiful prison </i>and he cannot be much in love with his 
    fetters, though they are made of gold. A holy person contemplates glory and 
    eternity; his desires have gotten wings and have fled to heaven. Grace is in 
    the heart like fire, which makes it sparkle upwards in divine desires and 
    prayers.</p>
    <font COLOR="#0000ff"><b>
    <p align="justify">3. A godly man is heavenly in his SPEECH</p>
    </b></font>
    <p align="justify">His words are sprinkled with salt to season others (Col. 
    4:6). As soon as Christ had risen from the grave, he was &quot;speaking of the 
    things pertaining to the kingdom of God&quot; (Acts 1:3). No sooner has a man 
    risen from the grave of unregeneracy than he is speaking of heaven. &quot;The 
    words of a wise man's mouth are gracious&quot; (Eccles. 4:12). He speaks in such 
    a heavenly manner, as if he were already in heaven. The love he has for God, 
    will not allow him to be silent. The spouse being sick with love, her tongue 
    was like the pen of a ready writer: &quot;My beloved is white and ruddy, his head 
    is as the most fine gold . . . &quot; (Song 5:10,11). Where there is a principle 
    of godliness in the heart—it will vent itself at the lips!</p>
    <p align="justify">(1) How can they be termed <i>godly</i>—who are possessed 
    with a dumb devil? They never have any good discourse. They are fluent and 
    discursive enough in secular things: they can speak of their wares and 
    shops, they can tell what a good crop they have—but in matters of religion 
    they are as if their tongue cleaved to the roof of their mouth! There are 
    many people in whose company you cannot tell what to make of them—whether 
    they are Turks or atheists, for they never speak a word of Christ!</p>
    <p align="justify">(2) How can they be termed <i>godly</i>—whose tongues are 
    set on fire by hell? Their lips do not drop honey—but poison, to the 
    defiling of others! Plutarch says that speech ought to be like <i>gold</i>, 
    which is of most value when it has least <i>dross </i>in it. Oh, the 
    unclean, malicious words that some people utter! What an unsavory stench 
    comes from these dunghills! Those lips that gallop so fast in sin, need 
    David's muzzle. &quot;I will watch my ways and keep my tongue from sin; I will 
    put a muzzle on my mouth,&quot; (Psalm 39:1). Can the body be healthy—when the 
    tongue is black? Can the heart be holy—when the devil is in the lips? A 
    godly man speaks &quot;the language of Canaan.&quot; &quot;Those who feared the Lord spoke 
    often one to another&quot; (Mal. 3:16).</p>
    <font COLOR="#0000ff"><b>
    <p align="justify">4. A godly man is heavenly in his ACTIONS</p>
    </b></font>
    <p align="justify">The motions of the planets are celestial. A godly man is 
    sublime and sacred in his motions; he works out salvation; he puts forth all 
    his strength, as they did in the Greek Olympics, so that he may obtain the 
    garland made of the flowers of paradise. He prays, fasts, watches, and takes 
    heaven by storm. He is divinely actuated, he carries on God's interest in 
    the world, he does angels' work, he is seraphic in his actions.</p>
    <font COLOR="#0000ff"><b>
    <p align="justify">5. A godly man is heavenly in his HOPES</p>
    </b></font>
    <p align="justify">His hopes are above the world (Psalm 39:7). &quot;In hope of 
    eternal life&quot; (Titus 1:2). A godly man casts anchor within the veil. He 
    hopes to have his fetters of sin filed off; he hopes for such things as eye 
    has not seen; he hopes for a kingdom when he dies—a kingdom promised by the 
    Father, purchased by the Son, assured by the Holy Spirit. As an heir lives 
    in hope of the time when such a great estate shall fall to him, so a child 
    of God, who is a co-heir with Christ, hopes for glory. This hope comforts 
    him in all varieties of condition: &quot;we rejoice in hope of the glory of God&quot; 
    (Romans 5:2).</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">(1) This hope comforts a godly man in AFFLICTION.</b></font> 
    Hope lightens and sweetens the most severe dispensations. A child of God can 
    rejoice when tears are in his eyes; the time is shortly coming when the 
    cross shall be taken off his shoulders and a crown set on his head! A saint 
    at present is miserable, with a thousand troubles; in an instant, he will be 
    clothed with robes of immortality, and advanced above seraphim!</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">(2) This hope comforts a godly man in DEATH. </b></font>
    &quot;The righteous has hope in his death&quot; (Proverbs 14:32). If one should ask a 
    dying saint, when all his earthly comforts have gone, what he had left, he 
    would say, &quot;the helmet of hope.&quot; I have read of a woman martyr who, when the 
    persecutors commanded that her breasts should be cut off, said, &quot;Tyrant, do 
    your worst; I have two breasts which you can not touch, the one of faith and 
    the other of hope.&quot; A soul that has this blessed hope is above the desire of 
    life or the fear of death. Would anyone be troubled at exchanging the lease 
    of a poor hut—for an inheritance that will be for him and his heirs? Who 
    would worry about parting with life, which is a lease that will soon run 
    out, to be possessed of a glorious inheritance in light?</p>
    <font COLOR="#0000ff"><b>
    <p align="justify">6. A godly man is heavenly in his CONDUCT</p>
    </b></font>
    <p align="justify">He casts such a luster of holiness as adorns his 
    profession. He lives as if he had seen the Lord with his bodily eyes. What 
    zeal, sanctity, humility, shines forth in his life! A godly person emulates 
    not only the angels—but imitates Christ himself (1 John 2:6). The 
    Macedonians celebrate the birthday of Alexander, on which day they wear his 
    picture round their necks, set with pearl and rich jewels. So a godly man 
    carries the lively picture of Christ about him, in the heavenliness of his 
    deportment: &quot;our conversation is in heaven&quot; (Phil. 3:20).</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">Use 1: </b></font>Those who are eaten up with the world 
    will be rejected, as ungodly, at the bar of judgment. To be godly and 
    earthly is a contradiction: &quot;For, as I have often told you before and now 
    say again even with tears—many live as enemies of the cross of Christ. Their 
    destiny is destruction, their god is their stomach, and their glory is in 
    their shame. Their mind is on earthly things.&quot; (Philippians 3:18-19). We 
    read that the earth swallowed up Korah alive (Numb. 16:32). This judgment is 
    on many—the earth swallows up their time, thoughts and discourse. They are 
    buried twice; their hearts are buried in the earth before their bodies. How 
    sad it is that the soul, that princely thing, which is made for communion 
    with God and angels, should be put to the mill to grind, and made a slave to 
    the earth! How like the prodigal the soul has become, choosing rather to 
    converse with swine and feed upon husks—than to aspire after communion with 
    the blessed Deity! Thus does Satan befool men, and keep them from heaven by 
    making them seek a heaven here on earth.</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">Use 2: </b></font>As we would prove ourselves to be &quot;born 
    of God&quot;, let us be of a sublime, heavenly temper. We shall never go to 
    heaven when we die—unless we are in heaven while we live. That we may be 
    more noble and raised in our affections, let us seriously weigh these four 
    considerations:</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">1. God himself sounds a retreat to us to call us off the 
    world.</b></font> &quot;Love not the world&quot; (1 John 2:15). We may use it as a 
    bouquet of flowers to smell—but it must not lie like a bundle of myrrh 
    between our breasts. &quot;Be not conformed to this world&quot; (Romans 12:2). Do not 
    hunt after its honors and profits. God's providences, like his precepts, are 
    to beat us off the world. Why does he send war and epidemics? What does the 
    heat of this great anger mean? Surely <i>dying times </i>are to make men die 
    to the world.</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">2. Consider how much below a Christian it is to be 
    earthly-minded.</b></font> We sometimes laugh at children when we see them 
    busying themselves with toys, kissing and hugging their dolls, etc., when we 
    do the same! At death, what will all the world be, which we so hug and 
    kiss—but like a rag doll? It will yield us no more comfort then. How far it 
    is below a heaven-born soul to be taken up with these things! No, when such 
    as profess to be ennobled with a principle of piety and to have their hopes 
    above, have their hearts below, how they disparage their heavenly calling 
    and spot their silver wings of grace, by besmirching them with earth!</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">3. Consider what a poor, contemptible thing the world is.
    </b></font>It is not worth setting the affections on; it cannot fill the 
    heart. If Satan should take a Christian up <i>the mount of temptation </i>
    and show him all the kingdoms and glory of the world, what could he show him 
    but a deceitful dream? Nothing here can be proportionate to the immense soul 
    of man. &quot;In the fullness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits&quot; (Job 
    20:22). Here is lack in plenty. The creature will no more fill the soul than 
    a drop will fill the bucket. That little sweet which we suck from the 
    creature, is intermixed with bitterness, like that cup which the Jews gave 
    Christ. &quot;They gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh&quot; (Mark 15:23). And 
    this imperfect sweet will not last long: &quot;the world passes away&quot; (1 John 
    2:17). The creature merely greets us, and is soon on the wing. The world 
    constantly changes. It is never constant except in its disappointments. How 
    quickly we may remove our lodgings and make our pillow in the dust! The 
    world is but a great inn where we are to stay a night or two, and then be 
    gone. What madness it is so to set our heart upon our inn—as to forget our 
    eternal home!</p>

    <p align="justify">4. Consider what a glorious place heaven is.</b></font> 
    We read of an angel coming down from heaven who &quot;set his right foot upon the 
    sea, and his left foot on the earth&quot; (Rev. 10:2). Had we only once been in 
    heaven, and viewed its superlative glory, how we might in holy scorn trample 
    with one foot on the earth and with the other foot on the sea! Heaven is 
    called a better country: &quot;But now they desire a better country, that is, a 
    heavenly one&quot; (Heb. 11:16). Heaven is said to be a better country, in 
    opposition to the country where we are now staying. What should we seek, but 
    that better country?</p>

    <p align="justify">Question: In what sense is heaven a better country?</p>
    </font><font COLOR="#b07050">
    <p align="justify">Answer 1: In that country above there are better 
    DELIGHTS. </font></b>There is the tree of life, and the rivers of pleasure. 
    There is amazing beauty, and unsearchable riches. There are the delights of 
    angels. There is the flower of joy fully blown. There is more than we can 
    ask or think (Eph. 3:20). There is glory in its full dimensions—and beyond 
    all hyperbole.</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">Answer 2: In that country there is a better HOME.</p>
    </b></font>
    <p align="justify">(1) It is a house &quot;not made with hands&quot; (2 Cor. 5:1). To 
    denote its excellence, there was never any house, but was made with hands. 
    But the house above surpasses the art of man or angel; none besides <i>God
    </i>could lay a stone in that building.</p>
    <p align="justify">(2) It is &quot;eternal in the heavens.&quot; It is not a <i>guest
    </i>house but a <i>mansion </i>house. It is a house that will never be out 
    of repair. &quot;Wisdom has built her house, she has hewn out her seven pillars&quot; 
    (Proverbs 9:1), which can never moulder.</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">Answer 3: In that country there are better PROVISIONS.
    </b></font>In our Father's house, there is bread enough. Heaven was typified 
    by Canaan, which flowed with milk and honey. There is the royal feast, the 
    spiced wine; there is angels' food. There they serve up those rare foods and 
    dainties, such as exceed not only our expressions—but our imaginations.</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">Answer 4: In that country there is better SOCIETY.</b></font> 
    There is God blessed forever. How infinitely sweet and ravishing will a 
    smile of his face be! The king's presence makes the court. There are the 
    glorious cherubim. In this terrestrial country where we now live, we are 
    among wolves and serpents; in that country above, we shall be among angels! 
    There are &quot;the spirits of just men made perfect&quot; (Heb. 12:23). Here on 
    earth, the people of God are clouded with infirmities; we see them with <i>
    spots </i>on their faces; they are full of pride, passion, censoriousness. 
    In that Jerusalem above, we shall see them in their royal attire, decked 
    with unparalleled beauty, not having the least tincture or shadow of sin on 
    them!</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">Answer 5: In that country there is a better AIR to 
    breathe in.</b></font> We go <i>into the country</i> for air; the best air 
    is only to be had in that better country: </p>
    <p align="justify">(1) It is a more <b>temperate </b>air; the climate is 
    calm and moderate; we shall neither freeze with the cold, nor faint with the 
    heat. </p>
    <p align="justify">(2) It is a <b>brighter </b>air; there is a better light 
    shining there. The Sun of righteousness enlightens that horizon with his 
    glorious beams: &quot;the Lamb is the light thereof&quot; (Rev. 21:23). </p>
    <p align="justify">(3) It is a <b>purer </b>air. The marshes, which are full 
    of foul vapors, we count a bad air and unwholesome to live in. This world is 
    a place of bogs and marshes, where the noxious vapors of sin arise, which 
    make it pestilential and unwholesome to live in. But in that country above, 
    there are none of these vapors—but a sweet perfume of holiness. There is the 
    smell of the orange-tree and the pomegranate. There is the myrrh and cassia 
    coming from Christ, which send forth a most fragrant scent.</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">Answer 6: In that country there is a better SOIL.</b></font> 
    The land or soil is better:</p>
    <p align="justify">(1) For its <i><b>altitude</b></i>. The earth, lying low, 
    is of a baser pedigree; the element which is nearest heaven is purer and 
    more excellent, like the fire. That country above is the high country; it is 
    seated far above all the visible orbs (Psalm 24:3).</p>
    <p align="justify">(2) For its <i><b>fertility</b>;</i> it bears a richer 
    crop. The the country above yields noble commodities. There are celestial 
    pearls; there is the spiritual vine; there is the honeycomb of God's love 
    dropping; there is the water of life, the hidden manna. There is which that 
    does not rot, flowers which never fade. There is a crop which cannot be 
    fully reaped; it will always be reaping time in heaven, and all this the 
    land yields, without the labor of ploughing and sowing.</p>
    <p align="justify">(3) For its <i><b>inoffensiveness</b></i>. There are no 
    briars there. The world is a wilderness where there are wicked men, and the 
    &quot;best of them is a brier&quot; (Micah 7:4). They tear the people of God in their 
    spiritual liberties—but in the country above there is not one briar to be 
    seen; all the briars are burned.</p>
    <p align="justify">(4) For the <b><i>rarity</i> </b>of the prospect; all 
    that a man sees there is his own. I account that the best prospect, where a 
    man can see furthest on his own ground.</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">Answer 7: In that country there is better UNITY.</b></font> 
    All the inhabitants are knit together in love. The poisonous weed of <i>
    malice </i>does not grow there. There is harmony without division, and 
    charity without envy. In that country above, as in Solomon's temple, no 
    noise of hammer is heard.</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">Answer 8: In that country there is better EMPLOYMENT. </b>
    </font>While we are here, we are complaining of our needs, weeping over our 
    sins—but there we shall be praising God. How the <i>birds of paradise</i> 
    will chirp when they are in that celestial country! There the morning stars 
    will sing together, and all the saints of God will shout for joy.</p>
    <p align="justify">Oh, what should we aspire after but this country above? 
    Such as have their eyes opened, will see that it infinitely excels! An 
    ignorant man looks at a star and it appears to him like a little silver 
    spot—but the astronomer, who has his instrument to judge the dimension of a 
    star, knows it to be infinitely larger than the earth. So a natural man 
    hears of the heavenly country that it is very glorious—but it is at a great 
    distance. And because he has not a spirit of discernment, the world looks 
    bigger in his eye. But such as are spiritual artists, who have the 
    instrument of faith to judge heaven, will say it is by far the better 
    country and they will hasten there with the sails of desire.</p>

    <font COLOR="#ff0000"><b>
    <p align="justify">15. A godly man is a ZEALOUS man</p>
    </b></font></h2>
    <p align="justify">Grace turns a <i>saint </i>into a <i>seraph</i>—it makes 
    him burn in holy zeal. Zeal is a mixed affection, a compound of love and 
    anger. It carries forth our <i>love to God</i>, and <i>anger against sin</i>—in 
    the most intense manner. Zeal is the flame of the affections; a godly man 
    has a double baptism—of water and <i>fire</i>. He is baptized with a spirit 
    of <i>zeal</i>; he is zealous for God's honor, truth, worship: &quot;My zeal has 
    consumed me&quot; (Psalm 119:139). It was a crown set on Phineas' head that he 
    was zealous for his God (Numb. 25:13). Moses is touched with a coal from 
    God's altar and in his zeal he breaks the tablets (Exod. 32:19). Our blessed 
    Savior in his zeal whips the buyers and sellers out of the temple: &quot;Zeal for 
    your house will consume me&quot; (John 2:17).</p>
    <p align="justify">But there is a <i>false heat</i>—something looking like 
    zeal, which it is not. A comet looks like a star. I shall therefore show 
    some differences between a true and a false zeal:</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">1. A false zeal is a BLIND zeal</p>
    </b></font>
    <p align="justify">&quot;They have a zeal of God—but not according to knowledge&quot; 
    (Romans 10:2). This is not the fire of the spirit—but wildfire. The <i>
    Athenians </i>were very devout and zealous—but they did not know for all 
    that. &quot;I found an altar with this inscription, To the unknown God&quot; (Acts 
    17:23). Thus the <i>Papists </i>are zealous in their way—but they have taken 
    away the key of knowledge.</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">2. A false zeal is a SELF-SEEKING zeal</p>
    </b></font>
    <p align="justify">Jehu cries, &quot;Come, see my zeal for the Lord!&quot; (2 Kings 
    16). But it was not zeal—but ambition; he was fishing for a crown. Demetrius 
    pleads for the goddess Diana—but it was not her temple—but her <i>silver </i>
    shrines, that he was zealous for (Acts 19:25-27). Such zealots Ignatius 
    complains of in his time, that they made a trade of Christ and religion, by 
    which to enrich themselves. It is probable that many in King Henry VIII's 
    time were eager to pull down the abbeys, not out of any zeal against 
    popery—but that they might build their own houses upon the ruins of those 
    abbeys, like vultures which fly aloft but their eyes are down upon their 
    prey. If blind zeal is punished sevenfold, hypocritical zeal shall be 
    punished seventy-sevenfold.</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">3. A false zeal is a MISGUIDED zeal</p>
    </b></font>
    <p align="justify">It occurs most in things which are not commanded. It is 
    the sign of a hypocrite to be zealous for <i>traditions </i>and useless of 
    institutions. The Pharisees were more zealous about washing their cups, than 
    their hearts.</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">4. A false zeal is fired with ANGER</p>
    </b></font>
    <p align="justify">James and John, when they wished to call down for fire 
    from heaven, were rebuked by our Savior: &quot;You know not what manner of spirit 
    you are of&quot; (Luke 9:55). It was not zeal—but anger. Many have espoused the 
    cause of religion, rather out of <i>faction </i>and <i>fancy, </i>than out 
    of zeal for the truth.</p>
    <p align="justify">But the <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>zeal of a godly man</b></font> 
    is a true and holy zeal which evidences itself in its effects:</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">1. True zeal cannot bear an injury done to God</p>
    </b></font>
    <p align="justify">Zeal makes the blood rise when God's honor is impeached. 
    &quot;I know your works, and your labor, and your patience, and how you cannot 
    tolerate those who are evil&quot; (Rev. 2:2). He who zealously loves his friend, 
    cannot hear him spoken against and be silent.</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">2. True zeal will encounter the greatest difficulties</p>
    </b></font>
    <p align="justify">When the world holds out of danger to discourage us, zeal 
    casts out fear. Zeal is quickened by opposition. Zeal does not say, &quot;There 
    is a lion in the way!&quot; Zeal will charge through an <i>army of dangers</i>, 
    it will march in the face of death. Let news be brought to Paul that he was 
    waylaid; &quot;in every city bonds and afflictions&quot; awaited him. This set a 
    keener edge upon his zeal: &quot;I am ready not to be <i>bound </i>only—but also 
    to <i>die </i>for the name of the Lord Jesus!&quot; (Acts 21:13). As sharp frosts 
    by force of contrast make the fire burn hotter, so sharp oppositions only 
    inflame zeal the more.</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">3. As true zeal has knowledge to go before it, so it has 
    sanctity to follow after it</p>
    </b></font>
    <p align="justify">Wisdom leads the van of zeal, and holiness brings up the 
    rear. A hypocrite seems to be zealous—but he is wicked. The godly man is 
    white and ruddy; <i>white </i>in purity, as well as <i>ruddy </i>in zeal. 
    Christ's zeal was hotter than the fire, and his holiness purer than the sun.</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">4. Zeal that is genuine loves truth when it is despised 
    and opposed</p>
    </b></font>
    <p align="justify">&quot;They have made void your law. Therefore I love your 
    commandments above gold&quot; (Psalm 119:126,127). The more others <i>deride </i>
    holiness, the more we <i>love </i>it. What is religion the worse, for others 
    disgracing it? Does a <i>diamond </i>sparkle the less because a blind man 
    disparages it? The more <i>outrageous </i>the wicked are against the truth, 
    the more <i>courageous </i>the godly are for it. When Michal scoffed at 
    David's pious dancing before the ark, he said, &quot;If this is to be vile, I 
    will yet be more vile&quot; (2 Sam. 6:22).</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">5. True zeal causes fervency in duty</p>
    </b></font><i>
    <p align="justify">&quot;Fervent in spirit&quot; (Romans 12:1</i>). Zeal makes us—<i>hear
    </i>with reverence, <i>pray </i>with affection, <i>love </i>with ardency. 
    God kindled Moses' sacrifice from heaven: &quot;Fire came out from the presence 
    of the Lord and consumed the burnt offering&quot; (Lev. 9:24). When we are 
    zealous in devotion, and our heart waxes hot within us—here is a fire from 
    heaven kindling our sacrifice. How odious it is for a man to be all fire 
    when he is <i>sinning</i>, and all ice when he is <i>praying!</i> A pious 
    heart, like water seething hot, boils over in holy affections!</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">6. True zeal is persevering</p>
    </b></font>
    <p align="justify">Though it is violent, it is perpetual. No waters can 
    quench the flame of zeal, it is torrid in the frigid zone. The heat of zeal 
    is like the natural heat coming from the heart, which lasts as long as life. 
    That zeal which is not constant, was never true.</p>
    <font COLOR="#0000ff"><b>
    <p align="justify">Use 1:</b></font> How opposite to godliness are those who 
    cry down zeal, and count it a religious frenzy! They are for the light of 
    knowledge—but not for the heat of zeal. When Basil was earnest in preaching 
    against the Arian heresy, it was interpreted as folly. Religion is a matter 
    requiring zeal; the kingdom of heaven will not be taken, except by violence 
    (Matt. 11:12).</p>
    <i>
    <p align="justify">Objection:</i> But why so much fervor in religion? What 
    becomes of <b>prudence </b>then?</p>
    <i>
    <p align="justify">Answer:</i> Though prudence is to direct zeal—yet it is 
    not to destroy it. Because sight is requisite, must the body therefore have 
    no heat? If prudence is the <i>eye </i>in religion, zeal is the <i>heart</i>.</p>
    <i>
    <p align="justify">Question:</i> But where is <b>moderation</b>?</p>
    <i>
    <p align="justify">Answer:</i> Though moderation in things of indifference 
    is commendable, and doubtless it would greatly tend to settling the peace of 
    the church—yet in the main articles of faith, wherein God's glory and our 
    salvation lie at stake, here moderation is nothing but sinful neutrality.
    </p>
    <i>
    <p align="justify">Objection:</i> But the apostle urges moderation: &quot;Let 
    your moderation be known to all&quot; (Phil. 4:5).</p>
    <i>
    <p align="justify">Answer:</p>
    </i>
    <p align="justify">1. <i>The apostle is speaking there of moderating our 
    passion</i>. The Greek word for &quot;moderation&quot; signifies candor and 
    meekness—the opposite of rash anger. And so the word is rendered in another 
    place &quot;patient&quot; (1 Tim. 3:3). By moderation, then, is meant meekness of 
    spirit. That is made clear by the subsequent words, &quot;The Lord is at hand&quot;—as 
    if the apostle had said, &quot;Avenge not yourselves, for the Lord is at hand.&quot; 
    He is ready to avenge your personal wrongs—but this in no way hinders a 
    Christian from being zealous in matters of religion.</p>
    <p align="justify">2. What strangers they are to godliness, who have no zeal 
    for the glory of God! They can see his ordinances despised, his worship 
    adulterated—yet their spirits are not at all stirred in them. How many are 
    of a dull, lukewarm temper, zealous for their own secular interest—but with 
    no zeal for the things of heaven! Hot in their own cause—but cool in God's 
    cause. The Lord most abominates lukewarm nominal Christians. I almost said 
    that he is sick of them. &quot;I wish you were either one or the other!&quot; 
    (anything but lukewarm); &quot;because you are neither cold nor hot, I will spue 
    you out of my mouth&quot; (Rev. 3:15,16). A lukewarm Christian is only 
    half-baked, just like Ephraim: &quot;Ephraim is a cake not turned&quot; (Hos. 7:8).
    </p>
    <p align="justify">I would ask these tepid, neutral professing Christians 
    this question, &quot;If religion is not a good cause, why did they undertake it 
    at first? If it is, why do they go about it so faintly? Why have they no 
    more holy ardor of soul?&quot; These people would gladly go to heaven on a soft 
    bed—but are loath to be carried there in a fiery chariot of zeal.<i> 
    Remember, God will be zealous against those who are not zealous; he provides 
    the fire of hell for those who lack the fire of zeal!</p>
    </i><font COLOR="#0000ff"><b>
    <p align="justify">Use 2:</b></font> As you would be found in the catalogue 
    of the godly, strive for zeal. It is better to be of no religion—than not to 
    be zealous in religion. Beware of carnal policy. This is one of those three 
    things which Luther feared would be the death of religion. Some men have 
    been too wise to be saved. Their discretion has quenched their zeal. Beware 
    of sloth, which is an enemy to zeal: &quot;be zealous therefore, and repent&quot; 
    (Rev. 3:19). Christians, what do you reserve your zeal for? Is it for your 
    gold which perishes; or for your sinful passions which will make you perish? 
    Can you bestow your zeal better than upon God? </p>
    <p align="justify">How zealous men have been in a false religion! &quot;They 
    lavish gold out of the bag, and weigh silver in the balance&quot; (Isaiah 46:6). 
    The Jews did not spare any cost in their idolatrous worship. No, they &quot;cause 
    their sons and daughters to pass through the fire to Molech&quot; (Jer. 32:35). 
    They were so zealous in their idol worship that they would sacrifice their 
    sons and daughters to their false gods. How far the blind heathen went in 
    their false zeal! When the tribunes of Rome complained that they needed gold 
    in their treasuries to offer to Apollo, the Roman matrons plucked off their 
    chains of gold, and rings, and bracelets—and gave them to the priests to 
    offer up sacrifice. Were these so zealous in their sinful worship, and will 
    you not be zealous in the worship of the true God? </p>
    <p align="justify">Do you lose anything by your zeal? Shall it not be 
    superabundantly recompensed? What is heaven worth? What is a sight of God 
    worth? Was not Jesus Christ zealous for you? He sweat drops of blood, he 
    conflicted with his Father's wrath. How zealous he was for your redemption, 
    and have you no zeal for him? Is there anything you yourselves hate more 
    than dullness and slothfulness in your servants? You are weary of such 
    servants. Do you dislike a dull spirit in others, and not in yourselves? 
    What are all your duties without zeal but mere fancies and nonentities?</p>
    <p align="justify">Do you know what a glorious thing zeal is? It is the 
    luster that sparkles from grace; it is the flame of love; it resembles the 
    Holy Spirit: &quot;There appeared cloven tongues like fire, which sat upon each 
    of them, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit&quot; (Acts 2:3,4). <i>
    Tongues of fire </i>were an emblem to represent that <i>fire of zeal </i>
    which the Spirit poured upon them.</p>
    <p align="justify">Zeal makes all our pious performances prevail with God. 
    When the iron is red hot it enters best; and when our services are red hot 
    with zeal, they pierce heaven soonest!</p>

    <font COLOR="#ff0000"><b>
    <p align="justify">16. A godly man is a PATIENT man</p>
    </b></font></h2>
    <p align="justify">&quot;You have heard of the patience of Job&quot; (Jas. 5:11). 
    Patience is a star which shines in a dark night. There is a twofold 
    patience:</p>
    <font COLOR="#0000ff"><b>
    <p align="justify">1. Patience in waiting</p>
    </b></font>
    <p align="justify">If a godly man does not obtain his desire immediately, he 
    will wait until the mercy is ripe: &quot;My soul waits for the Lord&quot; (Psalm 
    130:6). There is good reason why God should have the timing of our mercies: 
    &quot;I, the Lord, will bring it all to pass at the <i>right </i>time&quot; (Isaiah 
    60:22). Deliverance may delay beyond our time—but it will not delay beyond
    <i>God's </i>time.</p>
    <p align="justify">Why should we not wait patiently for God? We are 
    servants; it becomes servants to be in a waiting posture. We wait for 
    everything else; we wait for the seed until it grows (Jas. 5:7). Why can we 
    not wait for God? God has waited for us (Isaiah 30:18). Did he not wait for 
    our repentance? How often did he come, year after year, before he found 
    fruit? Did God wait for us, and can we not wait for him? A godly man is 
    content to await God's leisure; though the vision is delayed, he will wait 
    for it (Hab. 2:3).</p>
    <font COLOR="#0000ff"><b>
    <p align="justify">2. Patience in bearing trials</p>
    </b></font>
    <p align="justify">This patience is twofold: </p>
    <p align="justify">(a) Patience in regard to <b>man</b>—when we bear 
    injuries without revenging.</p>
    <p align="justify">(b) Patience in regard to <b>God</b>—when we bear his 
    hand without repining. A good man will not only do God's will—but bear his 
    will: &quot;I will bear the indignation of the Lord&quot; (Mic. 7:9). This patient 
    bearing of God's will is not:</p>
    <p align="justify">(1) <i>A stoical apathy;</i> patience is not <i>
    insensitivity </i>under God's hand; we ought to be sensitive.</p>
    <p align="justify">(2) <i>Enforced patience</i>, to bear a thing because we 
    cannot help it, which (as Erasmus said) is rather necessity than patience. 
    But <i>patience is a cheerful submission of our will to God</i>. &quot;May the 
    will of the Lord be done&quot; (Acts 21:14). A godly man acquiesces in what God 
    does, as being not only <i>good</i>, but <i>best </i>for himself. The great 
    quarrel between God and us is, &quot;Whose will shall stand?&quot; Now the regenerate 
    will falls in with the will of God. <font COLOR="#008000"><b>There are four 
    things which are opposite to this patient frame of soul:</p>
    </b></font><font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">(a) Disquiet of spirit</b></font>, when the soul is 
    discomposed and pulled off the hinges, insomuch that it is unfit for holy 
    duties. When the strings of a lute are snarled up, the lute is not fit to 
    make music. So when a Christian's spirit is perplexed and disturbed, he 
    cannot make melody in his heart to the Lord.</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">(b) Discontent</b></font>, which is a sullen, dogged 
    mood. When a man is not angry at his sins—but at his condition, this is 
    different from patience. <i>Discontent is the daughter of pride.</p>
    </i><font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">(c) Defection</b></font>, which is a dislike of God and 
    his ways, and a falling off from religion. Sinners have hard thoughts of 
    God, and if he just touches them on a sore spot, they will at once go away 
    from him and throw off his livery.</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">(d) Self-vindication</b></font>, when instead of being 
    humbled under God's hand, a man justifies himself, as if he had not deserved 
    what he suffers. A proud sinner stands upon his own defense, and is ready to 
    accuse God of unrighteousness, which is as if we should accuse the sun with 
    darkness. This is far from patience. <i>A godly man subscribes to God's 
    wisdom, and submits to his will. </i>He says not only, &quot;Good is the <i>word
    </i>of the Lord&quot; (Isaiah 39:8)—but &quot;Good is the <i>rod </i>of the Lord!&quot; </p>
    <font COLOR="#0000ff"><b>
    <p align="justify">Use: </b></font>As we would demonstrate ourselves to be 
    godly, let us be eminent in this grace of patience: &quot;the patient in spirit 
    is better than the proud in spirit&quot; (Eccles. 7:8). There are some graces 
    which we shall have no need of in heaven. We shall have no need of faith 
    when we have full vision, nor patience when we have perfect joy—but in a 
    dark sorrowful night there is need of these stars to shine (Heb. 10: 36). 
    Let us show our patience in bearing God's will. Patience in bearing God's 
    will is twofold:</p>
    <p align="justify">1. When God removes any comfort from us.</p>
    <p align="justify">2. When God imposes any trouble on us.</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">1. We must be patient when God removes any comfort from 
    us.</b></font> If God takes away any of our relations—&quot;I take away the 
    desire of your eyes with a stroke&quot; (Ezek. 24:16)—it is still our duty 
    patiently to acquiesce in the will of God. The loss of a dear relation is 
    like pulling away a limb from the body. &quot;A man dies every time he loses his 
    own kith and kin.&quot; But grace will make our hearts calm and quiet, and 
    produce holy patience in us under such a severe dispensation. I shall lay 
    down eight considerations which may act like <i>spiritual medicine to kill 
    the worm of impatience </i>under the loss of relations:</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">(1) The Lord never takes away any comfort from his 
    people, without giving them something better.</b></font> The disciples 
    parted with Christ's physical presence, and he sent them the Holy Spirit. 
    God eclipses one joy, and augments another. He simply makes an exchange; he 
    takes away a flower, and gives a diamond.</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">(2) When godly friends die, they are in a better 
    condition.</b></font> They are taken away &quot;from the evil to come&quot; (Isaiah 
    57:1). They are out of the <i>storm</i>, and have gone to the <i>haven!</i> 
    &quot;Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord&quot; (Rev. 14:13). The godly have a 
    portion promised them upon their marriage to Christ—but the portion is not 
    paid until the day of their death. The saints are promoted at death to 
    communion with God; they have what they so long hoped for, and prayed for. 
    Why, then, should we be impatient at our friends' promotion?</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">(3) You who are a saint, have a friend in heaven whom you 
    cannot lose. </b></font>The Jews have a saying at their funerals, &quot;Let your 
    consolation be in heaven.&quot; Are you mourning somebody close to you? Look up 
    to heaven and draw comfort from there; your best kindred are above. &quot;When my 
    father and my mother forsake me, then the Lord will take me up&quot; (Psalm 
    27:10). God will be with you in the hour of death: &quot;though I walk through 
    the valley of the shadow of death, you are with me&quot; (Psalm 23:4). Other 
    friends, you cannot keep. God is a friend you cannot lose. He will be your
    <i>guide </i>in life; your <i>hope </i>in death; your <i>reward </i>after 
    death!</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">(4) Perhaps God is correcting you for a fault, and if so, 
    it befits you to be patient. </b></font>It may be your friend had more of 
    your love than God did, and therefore God took away such a relation, so that 
    the stream of your love might run back to him again. A gracious woman had 
    been deprived, first of her children, then of her husband. She said, &quot;Lord, 
    you intend to have all my love.&quot; God does not like to have any creature set 
    upon the throne of our affections; he will take away that comfort, and then 
    he shall lie nearest our heart. If a husband bestows a jewel on his wife, 
    and she so falls in love with that jewel as to forget her husband, he will 
    take away the jewel so that her love may return to him again. A dear 
    relation is this jewel. If we begin to idolize it, God will take away the 
    jewel, so that our love may return to him again.</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">(5) A godly relation is <i>parted </i>with—but not <i>
    lost</i>.</b></font> That is lost, which we have no hope ever of seeing 
    again. Pious friends have only gone a little ahead of us. A time will 
    shortly come when there shall be a meeting without parting (1 Thess. 5:10). 
    How glad one is to see a long-absent friend! Oh, what glorious joy there 
    will be, when old relations meet together in heaven, and are in each other's 
    embraces! When a great prince lands at the shore, the guns go off in token 
    of joy; when godly friends have all landed at the heavenly shore and 
    congratulate one another on their happiness, what stupendous joy there will 
    be! What music in the choir of angels! How heaven will ring with their 
    praises! And that which is the crown of all, those who were joined in the 
    flesh here on earth, shall be joined nearer than ever in the mystic body, 
    and shall lie together in Christ's bosom, that bed of perfume (1 Thess. 
    4:17).</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">(6) We have deserved worse at God's hand. </b></font>Has 
    he taken away a child, a wife, a parent? He might have taken away his 
    Spirit. Has he deprived us of a relation? He might have deprived us of 
    salvation. Does he put wormwood in the cup? We have deserved poison. &quot;You 
    have punished us less than our iniquities deserve&quot; (Ezra 9:13). We have a 
    sea of sin—but only a drop of suffering.</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">(7) The patient soul enjoys itself most sweetly.</b></font> 
    An impatient man is like a troubled sea which cannot rest (Isaiah 57:20). He 
    tortures himself upon the rack of his own griefs and passions. Whereas 
    patience calms the heart, as Christ did the sea, when it was rough. Now 
    there is a sabbath in the heart, yes, a heaven. &quot;In your patience possess 
    your souls&quot; (Luke 21:19). By <i>faith </i>a man possesses God, and by <i>
    patience </i>he possesses himself.</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">(8) How patient many of the saints have been</b></font>, 
    when the Lord has broken the very staff of their comfort in bereaving them 
    of relations. The Lord took away Job's children and he was so far from 
    murmuring that he fell to blessing: &quot;Naked I came from my mother's womb, and 
    naked I will depart. The Lord <i>gave </i>and the Lord has <i>taken </i>
    away; may the name of the Lord be praised.&quot; (Job 1:21). God foretold the 
    death of Eli's sons: &quot;in one day both of them shall die,&quot; (1 Sam. 2:34). But 
    how patiently he took this sad news: &quot;It is the Lord's will. Let him do what 
    he thinks best.&quot; (1 Sam. 3:18). See the difference between Eli and Pharaoh! 
    Pharaoh said, &quot;Who is the Lord?&quot; (Exod. 5:2). Eli said, &quot;It is the Lord.&quot; 
    When God struck two of Aaron's sons dead, &quot;Aaron held his peace&quot; (Lev. 
    10:2,3). <i>Patience opens the ear—but shuts the mouth! </i>It opens the ear 
    to hear the rod—but shuts the mouth so that it has not a word to say against 
    God. See here the patterns of patience; and shall we not copy them? These 
    are heart-quietening considerations when God sets a <i>death's-head </i>upon 
    our comforts and removes dear relations from us.</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">2. We must be patient when God inflicts any TROUBLE on 
    us. </b></font>&quot;Patient in tribulation&quot; (Romans 12:12).</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">(1) God sometimes lays heavy affliction on his people:</b></font> 
    &quot;Your arrows have struck deep, and your blows are crushing me.&quot; (Psalm 
    38:2). The Hebrew word for &quot;afflicted&quot; signifies &quot;to be melted.&quot; God seems 
    to melt his people in a furnace.</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">(2) God sometimes lays various afflictions on the saints:</b></font> 
    &quot;he multiplies my wounds&quot; (Job 9:17). As we have various ways of <i>sinning</i>, 
    so the Lord has various ways of <i>afflicting</i>. Some he deprives of their
    <i>estates</i>; others he chains to a <i>sick </i>bed; others he confines to 
    a <i>prison</i>. God has various arrows in his quiver, which he shoots.</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">(3) Sometimes God lets the affliction lie for a long 
    time:</b></font> &quot;None of us knows how long this will last&quot; (Psalm 74:9). As 
    it is with diseases—some are chronic and linger and hang about the body 
    several years—so it is with afflictions. The Lord is pleased to exercise 
    many of his precious ones with chronic afflictions, which they suffer for a 
    long time. Now in all these cases, it befits the saints to rest patiently in 
    the will of God. The Greek word for &quot;patient&quot; is a metaphor and alludes to 
    one who stands invincibly under a heavy burden. This is the right notion of 
    patience, when we bear affliction invincibly without fainting or fretting.</p>
    <p align="justify">The test of a pilot is seen in a storm; so the test of a 
    Christian is seen in affliction. That man has the right art of navigation 
    who, when the boisterous winds blow from heaven, steers the ship of his soul 
    wisely, and does not dash upon the rock of impatience. A Christian should 
    always maintain decorum, not behaving himself in an unseemly manner or 
    acting with intemperate passion when the hand of God lies upon him. Patience 
    adorns suffering. Affliction in Scripture is compared to a net: &quot;You brought 
    us into the net&quot; (Psalm 66:11). Some have escaped the devil's net—yet the 
    Lord allows them to be taken in the <i>net of affliction</i>. But they must 
    not be &quot;as a wild bull in a net&quot; (Isaiah 51:20), kicking and flinging 
    against their Maker—but lie patiently until God breaks the net and makes a 
    way for their escape. I shall propound<i> four potent arguments to encourage 
    patience under those troubles which God inflicts on us:</p>
    </i><font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">(a) Afflictions are for our profit, for our benefit:</b></font> 
    &quot;God disciplines us for our good, that we may share in his holiness.&quot; (Heb. 
    12:10). We pray that God would take such a course with us as may do our 
    souls good. When God is afflicting us, he is hearing our prayers; he does it 
    &quot;for our good.&quot; Not that afflictions in themselves profit us—but as God's 
    Spirit works with them. For as the waters of Bethesda could not give health 
    of themselves, unless the angel descended and stirred them (John 5:4), so 
    the waters of affliction are not in themselves healing until God's Spirit 
    co-operates and sanctifies them to us. Afflictions are profitable in many 
    ways:</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">(1) They make men sober and wise.</b></font> Physicians 
    have mental patients bound in chains and put on a frugal diet to bring them 
    to the use of reason. Many run stark mad in prosperity; they know neither 
    God nor themselves. The Lord therefore binds them with cords of affliction, 
    so that he may bring them to their right minds. &quot;If they are held in cords 
    of affliction, then he shows them their transgressions. He opens also their 
    ear to discipline&quot; (Job 36:8-10).</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">(2) Afflictions are a friend to grace:</p>
    </b></font>
    <p align="justify">(A) They <b>beget </b>grace. Beza acknowledged that God 
    laid the foundation of his conversion, during a violent sickness in Paris.</p>
    <p align="justify">(B) They <b>augment </b>grace. The people of God are 
    indebted to their troubles; they would never have had so much grace, if they 
    had not met with such severe trials. Now the waters run, and the spices flow 
    forth. The saints thrive by affliction as the Lacedemonians grew rich by 
    war. God makes grace flourish most in the fall of the leaf.</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">(3) Afflictions quicken our pace on the way to heaven.</b></font> 
    It is with us as with children sent on an errand. If they meet with apples 
    or flowers by the way, they linger and are in no great hurry to get home—but 
    if anything frightens them, then they run with all the speed they can, to 
    their father's house. So in prosperity, we gather the apples and flowers and 
    do not give much thought to heaven—but if troubles begin to arise and the 
    times grow frightful, then we make more haste to heaven and with David &quot;run 
    the way of God's commandments&quot; (Psalm 119:32).</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">(b) God intermixes mercy with affliction.</b></font> He 
    steeps his <i>sword of justice </i>in the <i>oil of mercy</i>. There was no 
    night so dark but Israel had a pillar of fire in it. There is no condition 
    so dismal but we may see a pillar of fire to give us light. If the <i>body 
    is in pain, </i>and <i>conscience is at peace</i>—there is mercy. Affliction 
    is for the prevention of sin; there is mercy. In the ark there was &quot;a rod 
    and a pot of manna&quot;, the emblem of a Christian's condition: &quot;mercy 
    interlined with judgment&quot; (Psalm 101:1). Here is the rod and manna.</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">(c) Patience proves that there is much of God in the 
    heart. </b></font>Patience is one of God's titles: &quot;the God of patience&quot; 
    (Romans 15:5). If you have your heart cast in this blessed mold, it is a 
    sign that God has imparted much of his own nature to you; you shine with 
    some of his beams.</p>
    <p align="justify">Impatience proves that there is much unsoundness of 
    heart. If the body is of such a type that every little scratch of a pin 
    makes the flesh fester, you say, &quot;Surely this man's flesh is very unsound.&quot; 
    So impatience with every petty annoyance, and quarreling with providence—is 
    the sign of a disturbed Christian. If there is any grace in such a heart, 
    they who can see it must have good eyes. But he who is of a patient spirit 
    is a graduate in religion, and participates in much of the divine nature.</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">(d) The end of affliction is glorious. </b></font>The 
    Jews were <i>captive </i>in Babylon, but what was the end? They departed 
    from Babylon with vessels of silver, gold and precious things (Ezra 1:6). 
    So, what is the end of affliction? It ends in endless glory (Acts 14:22; 2 
    Cor. 4:17). How this may rock our impatient hearts quiet! Who would not 
    willingly travel along a little dirty path—at the end of which is a 
    priceless inheritance!</p>
    <i>
    <p align="justify">Question:</i> How shall I get my heart tuned to a patient 
    mood?</p>
    <i>
    <p align="justify">Answer:</i> Get faith; all our impatience proceeds from 
    unbelief. Faith is the breeder of patience. When a storm of passion begins 
    to arise, faith says to the heart, as Christ did to the sea, &quot;Peace, be 
    still&quot;, and there is at once a calm.</p>
    <i>
    <p align="justify">Question:</i> How does faith work patience?</p>
    <i>
    <p align="justify">Answer:</i> <b>Faith </b>argues the soul into patience. 
    Faith is like that town clerk in Ephesus who allayed the contention of the 
    multitude and argued them soberly into peace (Acts 19:35,36). So when 
    impatience begins to clamor and make a hubbub in the soul, faith appeases 
    the tumult and argues the soul into holy patience. Faith says, &quot;Why are you 
    disquieted, O my soul?&quot; (Psalm 42:5). Are you afflicted? Is it not your <i>
    Father </i>who has done it? He is carving and polishing you, and making you 
    fit for glory. He <i>smites </i>that he may <i>save</i>. What is your trial? 
    Is it sickness? God shakes the tree of your body so that some fruit may 
    fall, even &quot;the peaceable fruit of righteousness&quot; (Heb. 12:11). Are you 
    driven from your home? God has prepared a city for you (Heb. 11:16). Do you 
    suffer reproach for Christ's sake? &quot;The spirit of glory and of God rests 
    upon you&quot; (1 Pet. 4:14). Thus faith argues and disputes the soul into 
    patience.</p>
    <b>
    <p align="justify">Pray </b>to God for patience. Patience is a flower of 
    God's planting. Pray that it may grow in your heart, and send forth its 
    sweet perfume. Prayer is a holy charm, to charm down the evil spirit of 
    impatience. Prayer composes the heart and puts it in tune, when impatience 
    has broken the strings and put everything into confusion. Oh, go to God. 
    Prayer delights God's ear; it melts his heart; it opens his hand. God cannot 
    deny a praying soul. Seek him with importunity and either he will remove the 
    affliction—or, which is better, he will remove your impatience!</p>
    <h2><p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
    <font COLOR="#ff0000"><b>
    <p align="justify">17. A godly man is a THANKFUL man</p>
    </b></font></h2>
    <p align="justify">Praise and thanksgiving is the work of heaven; and he 
    begins that work here which he will always be doing in heaven. The Hebrew 
    word for &quot;praise&quot; comes from a root that signifies &quot;to shoot up.&quot; The godly 
    man sends up his praises like a volley of shots towards heaven. David was 
    modeled after God's heart and how melodiously he warbled out God's praises! 
    Therefore he was called &quot;the sweet psalmist of Israel&quot; (2 Sam. 23:1). Take a 
    Christian at his worst—yet he is thankful. The prophet Jonah was a man of 
    waspish spirit. The sea was not so stirred with the tempest, as Jonah's 
    heart was stirred with passion (Jonah 1:13). Yet through this cloud you 
    might see grace appear. He had a thankful heart: &quot;I will sacrifice unto you 
    with the voice of thanksgiving; I will pay that that I have vowed&quot; (Jonah 
    2:9). To illustrate this more clearly, I shall lay down these four 
    particulars:</p>
    <font COLOR="#0000ff"><b>
    <p align="justify">1. Praise and thanksgiving is a saint-like work</p>
    </b></font>
    <p align="justify">We find in Scripture that the godly are still called upon 
    to praise God: &quot;Praise the Lord; you who fear him, praise the Lord&quot; (Psalm 
    135:20). &quot;Let the saints be joyful in glory: let the high praises of God be 
    in their mouth&quot; (Psalm 149:5,6). Praise is a work proper to a saint:</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">(1) None but the godly can praise God aright. </b></font>
    As all do not have the skill to play the lute, so not everyone can sound 
    forth the harmonious praises of God. Wicked men are <i>bound </i>to praise 
    God—but they are not <i>fit </i>to praise him. None but a living Christian 
    can tune God's praise. Wicked men are dead in sin; how can they who are 
    dead, lift up God's praises? &quot;The grave cannot praise you&quot; (Isaiah 38:18). A 
    wicked man stains and eclipses God's praise. If a filthy hand works in 
    satin, it will slur its beauty. God will say to the sinner, &quot;What have you 
    to do, to take my covenant in your mouth?&quot; (Psalm 50:16).</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">(2) Praise is not lovely, for any but the godly:</b></font> 
    &quot;praise is lovely for the upright&quot; (Psalm 33:1). A profane man with God's 
    praises is like a dunghill with flowers. Praise in the mouth of a sinner, is 
    like a proverb in the mouth of a fool. How unfitting it is for anyone to 
    praise God—if his whole life dishonors God! It is as indecent for a wicked 
    man to praise God, as it is for a thief to talk of living by faith, or for 
    the devil to quote Scripture. The godly alone are fit to be choristers in 
    God's praises. It is called &quot;the garment of praise&quot; (Isaiah 61:3). This 
    garment fits handsomely only on a saint's back.</p>
    <font COLOR="#0000ff"><b>
    <p align="justify">2. Thanksgiving is a more noble part of God's worship </p>
    </b></font>
    <p align="justify">Our needs may send us to <i>prayer</i>, but it takes a 
    truly honest heart to <i>praise </i>God. The <i>raven </i>cries; the <i>lark
    </i>sings. In <i>petition </i>we act like men; in <i>thanksgiving </i>we act 
    like angels.</p>
    <font COLOR="#0000ff"><b>
    <p align="justify">3. Thanksgiving is a God-exalting work</p>
    </b></font>
    <p align="justify">&quot;Whoever offers praise glorifies me&quot; (Psalm 50:23). 
    Though nothing can add the least mite to God's essential glory—yet praise 
    exalts him in the eyes of others. Praise is a setting forth of God's honor, 
    a lifting up of his name, a displaying of the trophy of his goodness, a 
    proclaiming of his excellence, a spreading of his renown, a breaking open of 
    the box of ointment, whereby the sweet fragrance of God's name is sent 
    abroad into the world.</p>
    <font COLOR="#0000ff"><b>
    <p align="justify">4. Praise is a more distinguishing work</p>
    </b></font>
    <p align="justify">By this a Christian excels all the infernal spirits. Do 
    you talk of God? So can the devil; he brought Scripture to Christ. Do you 
    profess religion? So can the devil; he transforms himself into an angel of 
    light. Do you fast? He never eats. Do you believe? The devils have a faith 
    of assent; they believe, and tremble (Jas. 2:19). But as Moses worked such a 
    miracle as none of the magicians could reproduce, so here is a work 
    Christians may be doing, which none of the devils can do—and that is the 
    work of thanksgiving. The devils <i>blaspheme</i>—but do not <i>bless</i>. 
    Satan has his fiery darts but not his harp and violin.</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">Use 1:</b> </font>See here the true genius and 
    characteristic of a godly man. He is much in doxologies and praises. It is a 
    saying of Lactantius that he who is unthankful to his God cannot be a godly 
    man. A godly man is a God-exalter. The saints are temples of the Holy Spirit 
    (1 Cor. 3:16). Where should God's praises be sounded—but in his temples? A 
    good heart is never weary of praising God: &quot;his praise shall continually be 
    in my mouth&quot; (Psalm 34:1). Some will be thankful while the memory of the 
    mercy is fresh—but afterwards leave off. The Carthaginians at first to send 
    the tenth of their yearly revenue to Hercules—but by degrees they grew weary 
    and stopped sending. David, as long as he drew his breath, would chirp forth 
    God's praise: &quot;I will sing praises unto my God while I have any being&quot; 
    (Psalm146:2). David would not now and then give God a snatch of music, and 
    then hang up the instrument—but he would continually be celebrating God's 
    praise. </p>
    <p align="justify">A godly man will express his thankfulness in every <b>
    duty</b>. He mingles thanksgiving with prayer: &quot;in everything by prayer with 
    thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God&quot; (Phil. 4:6). 
    Thanksgiving is the more divine part of prayer. In our petitions we express 
    our own necessities; in our thanksgivings we declare God's excellences. 
    Prayer goes up as incense, when it is perfumed with thanksgiving.</p>
    <p align="justify">And as a godly man expresses thankfulness in every duty, 
    he does so in every <b>condition</b>. He will be thankful in adversity as 
    well as prosperity: &quot;In everything give thanks&quot; (1 Thess. 5:18). A gracious 
    soul is thankful and rejoices that he is drawn nearer to God, though it be 
    by the cords of affliction. When it goes <i>well </i>with him, he praises 
    God's mercy; when it goes <i>badly </i>with him, he magnifies God's justice. 
    When God has a <i>rod </i>in his hand, a godly man will have a <i>psalm </i>
    in his mouth. The devil's smiting of Job was like striking a musical 
    instrument; he sounded forth praise: &quot;Naked I came from my mother's womb, 
    and naked I will depart. The Lord gave and the Lord has taken away; may the 
    name of the Lord be praised&quot; (Job 1:21). When God's spiritual plants are cut 
    and bleed, they drop thankfulness; the saints' tears cannot drown their 
    praises.</p>
    <p align="justify">If this is the sign of a godly man, then the number of 
    the godly appears to be very small. Few are in the work of praise. Sinners 
    cut God short of his thank offering: &quot;Where are the <i>nine</i>?&quot; (Luke 
    17:17). Of ten lepers healed there was but <i>one </i>who returned to give 
    praise. Most of the world are sepulchers to bury God's praise. You will hear 
    some swearing and cursing—but few who bless God. Praise is the rent which 
    men owe to God—but most are behindhand with their rent. God gave King 
    Hezekiah a marvelous deliverance, &quot;but Hezekiah rendered not again according 
    to the benefit done unto him&quot; (2 Chron. 32:25). That &quot;but&quot; was a blot on his 
    escutcheon. </p>
    <p align="justify">Some, instead of being thankful to God, &quot;render evil for 
    good.&quot; They are the worse for mercy: &quot;Do you thus requite the Lord, O 
    foolish and unwise people?&quot; (Deut. 32:6). This is like the toad which turns 
    the most wholesome herb to poison. Where shall we find a grateful Christian? 
    We read of the saints &quot;having harps in their hands&quot; (Rev 5:8)—the emblem of 
    praise. Many have <i>tears </i>in their eyes and <i>complaints </i>in their 
    mouths—but few have <i>harps </i>in their hand and are blessing and praising 
    the name of God.</p>

    <p align="justify">Question: How may we know whether we are rightly 
    thankful?</p>
    </b></font><font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">Answer 1:</b></font> We are rightly thankful—when we are 
    careful to register God's mercies: &quot;David appointed certain of the Levites 
    to record, and to thank and praise the Lord God of Israel&quot; (1 Chron. 16:4). 
    Physicians say that the memory is the first thing which decays. It is true 
    in spiritual matters: &quot;They soon forgot his works&quot; (Psalm 106:13). A godly 
    man enters his mercies, as a physician does his remedies, in a book, so that 
    they may not be lost. Mercies are jewels that should be locked up. A child 
    of God keeps two books always by him: one to write his <i>sins </i>in—so 
    that he may be humble; the other to write his <i>mercies </i>in—so that he 
    may be thankful.</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">Answer 2: </b></font>We are rightly thankful—when our <i>
    hearts </i>are the chief instrument in the music of praise: &quot;I will praise 
    the Lord with my <i>whole heart</i>&quot; (Psalm 111:1). David would tune not 
    only his violin—but also his heart. If the heart does not join with the 
    tongue, there can be no true praise. Where the heart is not engaged, the 
    parrot is as good a chorister as the Christian.</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">Answer 3:</b></font> We are rightly thankful—when the 
    favors which we receive, endear our love to God the more. David's miraculous 
    preservation from death drew forth his love to God: &quot;I love the Lord&quot; (Psalm 
    116:1). It is one thing to love our <i>mercies</i>; it is another thing to 
    love the <i>Lord</i>. Many love their <i>deliverance, </i>but not their <i>
    deliverer</i>. God is to be loved more than his mercies.</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">Answer 4:</b></font> We are rightly thankful when, in 
    giving our praise to God, we see no worthiness from ourselves: &quot;I am not 
    worthy of the least of all the mercies you have showed unto your servant&quot; 
    (Gen. 32:10). As if Jacob had said, &quot;Lord, the worst bit you carve for me, 
    is better than I deserve.&quot; Mephibosheth bowed himself and said, &quot;What is 
    your servant, that you should look upon such a dead dog as I am?&quot; (2 Sam. 
    9:8). So when a thankful Christian makes a survey of his blessings and sees 
    how much he enjoys, that others better than he lack, he says, &quot;Lord, what am
    <i>I</i>, a dead dog, that free grace should look upon me, and that you 
    should crown <i>me </i>with such loving kindness!&quot;</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">Answer 5: </b></font>We are rightly thankful—when we put 
    God's mercy to good use. We repay God's blessings—with service. The Lord 
    gives us <i>health</i>—and we spend and are spent for Christ (2 Cor. 12:15). 
    He gives us an <i>estate</i>—and we honor the Lord with our substance 
    (Proverbs 3:9). He gives us <i>children</i>—and we dedicate them to God and 
    educate them for God. We do not bury our talents—but use them for God's 
    glory. This is to put our mercies to good use. A gracious heart is like a 
    piece of good ground that, having received the seed of mercy, produces a 
    crop of obedience.</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">Answer 6: </b></font>We are rightly thankful—when we can 
    have our hearts more enlarged for spiritual mercies—than for temporal 
    mercies: &quot;Blessed be God, who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings&quot; 
    (Eph. 1:3). A godly man blesses God more for a fruitful heart—than a full 
    crop. He is more thankful for Christ—than for a kingdom. Socrates was 
    accustomed to say that he loved the king's smile—more than his gold. A pious 
    heart is more thankful for a smile of God's face—than he would be for all 
    the gold of the Indies.</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">Answer 7:</b></font> We are rightly thankful—when mercy 
    is a spur to duty. It causes a spirit of activity for God. Mercy is not like 
    the sun to the fire, to dull it—but like oil to the wheel, to make it run 
    faster. David wisely argues from mercy to duty: &quot;You have delivered my soul 
    from death. I will walk before the Lord in the land of the living&quot; (Psalm 
    116:8,9). It was a saying of Bernard, &quot;Lord, I have two mites, a soul and a 
    body, and I give them both to you.&quot;</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">Answer 8:</b></font> We are rightly thankful—when we 
    motivate others to this angelic work of praise. David does not only wish to 
    bless God himself—but calls upon others to do so: &quot;Praise the Lord, all you 
    nations; extol him, all you peoples.&quot; (Psalm 117:1). The sweetest music is 
    that which is in unison. When many saints join together in unison, then they 
    make heaven ring with their praises. As one drunkard will be calling upon 
    another—so in a holy sense, one Christian must be stirring up another to the 
    work of thankfulness.</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">Answer 9:</b></font> We are rightly thankful—when we not 
    only <i>speak </i>God's praise—but <i>live </i>his praise. It is called an 
    expression of gratitude. We <i>give </i>thanks when we <i>live </i>thanks. 
    Such as are <i>mirrors of mercy </i>should be <i>patterns of piety</i>. 
    &quot;Upon Mount Zion shall be deliverance, and there shall be holiness&quot; (Obad. 
    17). To give God oral praise and dishonor him in our lives, is to commit a 
    barbarism in religion, and is to be like those Jews who bowed the knee to 
    Christ and then spit on him (Mark 15:19).</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">Answer 10: </b></font>We are rightly thankful—when we 
    propagate God's praises to posterity. We tell our children what God has done 
    for us: in such a <i>need </i>he supplied us; from such a <i>sickness </i>he 
    raised us up; in such a <i>temptation </i>he helped us. &quot;O God, our fathers 
    have told us, what work you did in their days, in the times of old&quot; (Psalm 
    44:1). By transmitting our experiences to our children, God's name is 
    eternalized, and his mercies will bring forth a plentiful crop of praise 
    when we are gone. Heman puts the question, &quot;shall the dead praise you?&quot; 
    (Psalm 88:10). Yes, in the sense that when we are dead, we praise God 
    because, having left the chronicle of God's mercies with our children, we 
    start them on thankfulness and so make God's praises live when we are dead.</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">Use 3: </b></font>Let us prove our godliness by 
    gratefulness: &quot;Give unto the Lord the glory due unto his name&quot; (Psalm 29:2).</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">1. It is a good thing to be thankful.</b></font> &quot;It is 
    good to sing praises unto our God&quot; (Psalm 147:1). It is bad when the tongue 
    (that organ of praise) is out of tune and jars by murmuring and discontent. 
    But it is a good thing to be thankful. It is good, because this is all the 
    creature can do to lift up God's name; and it is good because it tends to 
    make us good. The more <i>thankful </i>we are, the more <i>holy</i>. While 
    we pay this tribute of praise, our stock of grace increases. In other debts, 
    the more we pay, the less we have; but the more we pay this debt of 
    thankfulness, the more grace we have.</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">2. Thankfulness is the rent we owe to God. </b></font>
    &quot;Kings of the earth, and all people; let them praise the name of the Lord&quot; 
    (Psalm 148:11,13), Praise is the tribute or custom to be paid into the King 
    of heaven's treasury. Surely while God renews our lease, we must renew our 
    rent.</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">3. The great cause we have to be thankful.</b></font> It 
    is a principle grafted in nature—to be thankful for mercies received. Even 
    the heathen praised Jupiter for their victories.</p>
    <p align="justify">What full clusters of mercies hang on us when we go to 
    enumerate God's mercies! We must, with David, confess ourselves to be 
    bewildered: &quot;Many, O Lord my God, are your wonderful works which you have 
    done, they cannot be reckoned up in order&quot; (Psalm 40:5). And as God's 
    mercies are past <i>numbering</i>, so they are past <i>measuring</i>. David 
    takes the longest measuring line he could get. He measures from earth to the 
    clouds, no, above the clouds—yet this measure would not reach the heights of 
    God's mercies: &quot;Your mercy is great <i>above the heavens</i>&quot; (Psalm 108:4). 
    Oh, how God has enriched us with his silver showers! A whole constellation 
    of mercies has shone in our hemisphere.</p>
    <p align="justify">(1) What <b>temporal </b>favors we have received! Every 
    day we see a new tide of mercy coming in. The <i>wings of mercy</i> have 
    covered us; the <i>breast of mercy </i>has fed us: &quot;the God who fed me all 
    my life long unto this day&quot; (Gen. 48:15). What snares laid for us have been 
    broken! What fears have blown over! The Lord has made our <i>bed</i>, while 
    he has made others' <i>graves</i>. He has taken such care of us, as if he 
    had no one else to take care of. Never was the <i>cloud of providence </i>so 
    black—but we might see a <i>rainbow of love </i>in the cloud. We have been 
    made to swim in a sea of mercy! Does not all this call for thankfulness?</p>
    <p align="justify">(2) That which may put another string into the instrument 
    of our praise and make it sound louder—is to consider what <b>spiritual </b>
    blessings God has conferred on us. He has given us <i>water from the upper 
    springs</i>; he has opened the <i>wardrobe of heaven</i> and fetched us out 
    a better garment than any of the angels wear! He has given us the <i>best 
    robe</i>, and put on us the <i>ring of faith</i>, by which we are married to 
    him. These are mercies of the first magnitude, which deserve to have an 
    asterisk put on them. More—God keeps the best wine until last! Here on 
    earth, he gives us mercies only in small quantities; the greatest things are 
    laid up in heaven! Here on earth, there are some honey <i>drops </i>and <i>
    foretastes </i>of God's love; the <i>rivers </i>of pleasure are reserved for 
    paradise! Well may we take the harp and violin and triumph in God's praise. 
    Who can tread on these hot coals of God's love—and his heart not burn in 
    thankfulness!</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">4. Thankfulness is the best policy.</b></font> There is 
    nothing lost by it. To be thankful for one mercy is the way to have more. It 
    is like pouring water into a pump which fetches out more. Musicians love to 
    sound their trumpets where there is the best echo, and God loves to bestow 
    his mercies where there is the best echo of thankfulness.</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">5. Thankfulness is a frame of heart that God delights in.
    </b></font>If repentance is the joy of heaven, praise is the music. Bernard 
    calls thankfulness, &quot;the sweet balm that drops from a Christian.&quot;</p>
    <p align="justify">Four sacrifices God is very pleased with: the sacrifice 
    of Christ's blood; the sacrifice of a broken heart; the sacrifice of alms; 
    and the sacrifice of thanksgiving. Praise and thanksgiving (says Greenham) 
    is the most excellent part of God's worship, for this shall continue in the 
    heavenly choir when all other exercises of religion have ceased.</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">6. What a horrid thing ingratitude is! </b></font>It 
    gives a dye and tincture to every other sin and makes it crimson. 
    Ingratitude is the spirit of baseness: &quot;Your trusted friends will set traps 
    for you&quot; (Obad. 7). Ingratitude is worse than brutish (Isaiah 1:3). It is 
    reported of Julius Caesar that he would never forgive an ungrateful person. 
    Though God is a sin-pardoning God, he scarcely knows how to pardon for this. 
    &quot;How shall I pardon you for this? your children have forsaken me, when I had 
    fed them to the full, they then committed adultery&quot; (Jer. 5:7). Draco (whose 
    laws were written in blood) published an edict that if any man had received 
    a benefit from another, and it could be proved against him that he had not 
    been grateful for it, he should be put to death. An unthankful person is a 
    monster in nature—and a paradox in Christianity. He is the scorn of heaven 
    and the plague of earth. An ungrateful man never does well, except in one 
    thing—that is, when he dies. Then he becomes a monument of God's justice.</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">7. Not being thankful is the cause of all the judgments 
    which have lain on us.</b></font> Our unthankfulness for health has been the 
    cause of so much mortality. Our gospel unthankfulness and sermon-surfeiting 
    has been the reason why God has put so many lights under a bushel. Who will 
    spend money on a piece of ground that produces nothing but briars? 
    Unthankfulness stops up the golden vial of God's bounty, so that it will not 
    drop.</p>
    <i>
    <p align="justify">Question:</i> What shall we do to be thankful?</p>
    <b><i>
    <p align="justify">Answer</i> 1: If you wish to be thankful, get a heart 
    deeply humbled with the sense of your own vileness.</b> A broken heart is 
    the best pipe to sound forth God's praise. He who studies his sins wonders 
    that he has anything and that God should shine on such a dunghill: &quot;I was 
    once a blasphemer and a persecutor and a violent man, but I was shown mercy&quot; 
    (1 Tim. 1:13). How thankful Paul was! How he trumpeted forth free grace! A 
    proud man will never be thankful. He looks on all his mercies as either of 
    his own <i>procuring </i>or <i>deserving</i>. If he has an estate, this he 
    has got by his wits and industry, not considering that scripture, &quot;Always 
    remember that it is the Lord your God who gives you power to become rich&quot; 
    (Deut. 8:18). Pride stops the current of gratitude. O Christian, think of 
    your unworthiness; see yourself as the least of saints, and the chief of 
    sinners—and then you will be thankful.</p>
    <b><i>
    <p align="justify">Answer</i> 2: Strive for sound evidences of God's love to 
    you.</b> Read God's love in the impress of holiness upon your hearts. God's 
    love poured in will make the vessels of mercy run over with thankfulness: 
    &quot;Unto him that loved us, be glory and dominion forever!&quot; (Rev. 1:5,6). The 
    deepest springs yield the sweetest water. Hearts deeply aware of God's love 
    yield the sweetest praises</p>

    <font COLOR="#ff0000"><b>
    <p align="justify">18. A godly man is a lover of the saints</p>
    </b></font></h2>
    <p align="justify">The best way to discern grace in oneself—is to love grace 
    in others: &quot;We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we 
    love the brethren&quot; (1 John 3:14). What is religion—but a knitting together 
    of hearts? <i>Faith </i>knits us to God—and <i>love </i>knits us one to 
    another. There is a twofold love to others:</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">1. A civil love.</b></font> A godly man has a love of 
    civility to all: &quot;Abraham stood up, and bowed to the children of Heth&quot; (Gen. 
    23:7). Though they were extraneous and not within the pale of the 
    covenant—yet Abraham was affable to them. <b>Grace sweetens and refines 
    nature. </b>&quot;Be sympathetic, love as brothers, be compassionate and humble&quot; 
    (1 Pet. 3:8). We are to have a love of civility to all:</p>
    <p align="justify">(1) Because they are of the same clay, of the same lump 
    and mold with ourselves and are a piece of God's intricate needlework.</p>
    <p align="justify">(2) Because our sweet deportment towards them may be a 
    means to win them over and put them in love with the ways of God. Morose, 
    crude behavior, often alienates the hearts of others and hardens them most 
    against holiness, whereas loving behavior is very obliging and may be like a 
    loadstone to draw them to true religion.</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">2. A pious and a holy love. </b></font>This, a godly man 
    has chiefly for those who are &quot;of the household of faith&quot; (Gal. 6:10). The 
    first was a love of courtesy, this of delight. Our love to the saints (says 
    Augustine) should be more than to our natural relations, because the bond of 
    the Spirit is closer than that of blood. This love to the saints which shows 
    a man to be godly must have seven ingredients in it:</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">(1) Love to the saints must be SINCERE. </b></font>&quot;Let 
    us not love in word, neither in tongue—but in deed and in truth&quot; (1 John 
    3:18). The honey that drops from the comb is pure; so love must be pure, 
    without deceit. Many are like Naphtali: &quot;He gives goodly words&quot; (Gen. 
    49:21). <i>Pretended love </i>is like a <i>painted fire</i>, which has no 
    heat in it. Some hide malice under a false veil of love. I have read of 
    Antoninus the Emperor that where he made a show of friendship, he intended 
    the most mischief.</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">(2) Love to the saints must be SPIRITUAL.</b></font> We 
    must love them because they are saints, not out of self-respect because they 
    are affable or have been kind to us.</p>
    <p align="justify">But we must love them from spiritual considerations, 
    because of the good that is in them. We are to reverence their holiness, 
    else it is a carnal love.</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">(3) Love to the saints must be EXTENSIVE. </b></font>We 
    must love all who bear God's image:</p>
    <p align="justify">(a) We must love the saints, though they have many 
    infirmities. A Christian in this life is like a good face full of freckles. 
    You who cannot love another because of his imperfections, have never yet 
    seen your own face in the mirror. Your brother's infirmities may make you 
    pity him; his graces must make you love him.</p>
    <p align="justify">(b) We must love the saints, though in some things they 
    do not agree with us. Another Christian may differ from me in lesser 
    matters, either because he has more light than I, or because he has less 
    light. If he differs from me because he has more light, then I have no 
    reason to censure him. If he differs from me because he has less light, then 
    I ought to bear with him as the weaker vessel. In things of an indifferent 
    nature, there ought to be Christian forbearance.</p>
    <p align="justify">(c) We must love the saints, though their graces outvie 
    and surpass ours. We ought to bless God for the eminence of another's grace, 
    because hereby religion is honored. Pride is not quite slain in a believer. 
    Saints themselves are apt to grudge and repine at each other's excellences. 
    Is it not strange that the same person should hate one man for his sin and 
    envy another for his virtue? Christians need to look to their hearts. Love 
    is right and genuine, when we can rejoice in the graces of others though 
    they seem to eclipse ours.</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">(4) Love to the saints must be APPRECIATING. </b></font>
    We must esteem them above others: &quot;He honors those who fear the Lord&quot; (Psalm 
    15:4). We are to look upon the wicked as <i>chaff</i>—but upon the saints as
    <i>jewels</i>. These must be had in high veneration.</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">(5) Love to the saints must be SOCIAL.</b></font> We 
    should delight in their company: &quot;I am a companion of all those who fear 
    you&quot; (Psalm 119:63). It is a kind of hell to be in the company of the 
    wicked, where we cannot choose but hear God's name dishonored. It was a 
    capital crime to carry the image of Tiberius, engraved on a ring or coin, 
    into any sordid place. Those who have the image of God engraved on them 
    should not go into any sinful, sordid company. I have only ever read of two 
    living people who desired to keep company with the dead, and they were 
    possessed by the devil (Matt. 8:28). What comfort can a living Christian 
    have from conversing with the dead (Jude 12)? But the society of saints is 
    desirable. This is not to walk &quot;among the tombs&quot;—but &quot;among beds of spices.&quot; 
    Believers are Christ's garden; their graces are the flowers; their savory 
    discourse is the fragrant scent of these flowers.</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">(6) Love to the saints must be DEMONSTRATIVE.</b></font> 
    We should be ready to do all offices of love to them, vindicate their names, 
    contribute to their necessities and, like the good Samaritan, pour oil and 
    wine into their wounds (Luke 10:34,35). Love cannot be concealed—but is 
    active in its sphere and will lay itself out for the good of others.</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">(7) Love to the saints must be CONSTANT. </b></font>&quot;He 
    who <i>dwells </i>in love&quot; (1 John 4:16). Our love must not only lodge for a 
    night—but we must dwell in love: &quot;Let brotherly love continue&quot; (Heb. 13:1). 
    As love must be sincere, without hypocrisy; so it must be constant, without 
    deficiency. Love must be like the pulse, always beating, not like those 
    Galatians who at one time were ready to pluck out <i>their </i>eyes for Paul 
    (Gal. 4:15) and afterwards were ready to pluck out <i>his </i>eyes. Love 
    should expire only with our life. And surely if our love to the saints is 
    thus divinely qualified, we may hopefully conclude that we are enrolled 
    among the godly. &quot;By this shall all men know that you are my disciples—if 
    you have love one to another&quot; (John 13:35).</p>
    <p align="justify">What induces a godly man to love the saints is the fact 
    that he is closely related to them. There ought to be love among relations; 
    there is a spiritual kinship among believers. They all have one <i>head</i>, 
    therefore should all have one <i>heart</i>. They are stones of the same 
    building (1 Pet. 2:5), and shall not these stones be cemented together with 
    love?</p>
    <font COLOR="#0000ff"><b>
    <p align="justify">Use 1:</b></font> If it is the distinguishing mark of a 
    godly man to be a lover of the saints, then how sad it is to see this grace 
    of love in eclipse! This characteristic of godliness is almost blotted out 
    among Christians. England was once a fair garden where the flower of love 
    grew—but surely now this flower is either plucked, or withered. Where is 
    that amity and unity which there should be among Christians? I appeal to 
    you—would there be that censuring and despising, that reproaching and 
    undermining one another—if there were love? Instead of bitter <i>tears</i>, 
    there are bitter <i>spirits</i>. It is a sign that iniquity abounds when the 
    love of many grows cold. There is that distance among some professing 
    Christians as if they had not received the same Spirit, or as if they did 
    not hope for the same heaven. In primitive times there was so much love 
    among the godly—that it set the heathen wondering; and now there is so 
    little love—that it may set Christians blushing.</p>
    <font COLOR="#0000ff"><b>
    <p align="justify">Use 2:</b></font> As we would be written down for saints 
    in God's calendar, let us love the brotherhood (1 Pet. 2:17). Those who 
    shall one day <i>live </i>together, should <i>love </i>together. What is it 
    that makes a disciple, but love (John 13:35)? The devil has knowledge—but 
    that which makes him a devil is that he lacks love. To persuade Christians 
    to love, consider:</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">(1) The saints have that in them which may make us love 
    them.</b></font> They are the intricate embroidery and workmanship of the 
    Holy Spirit (Eph. 2:10). They have those rare lineaments of grace that none 
    but a pencil from heaven could draw. Their eyes sparkle forth beauty, &quot;their 
    breasts are like clusters of grapes&quot; (Song 7:7). This makes Christ himself 
    delight in his spouse: &quot;The king is held in the galleries&quot; (Song 7:5). The 
    church is the daughter of a prince (Song 7:1). She is waited on by angels 
    (Heb 1:14). She has a palace of glory reserved for her (John 14:2), and may 
    not all this draw forth our love?</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">(2) Consider how evil it is for saints not to love:</p>
    </b></font><font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">(a) It is UNNATURAL. </b></font>The saints are Christ's 
    lambs (John 21:15). For a <i>dog </i>to worry a lamb is usual—but for one <i>
    lamb </i>to worry another is unnatural. The saints are brethren (1 Peter 
    3:8). How barbarous it is for brethren not to love!</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">(b) Not to love is a FOOLISH thing.</b></font> Have not 
    God's people enemies enough, that they should fly in the faces of one 
    another? The wicked confederate against the godly: &quot;They have taken crafty 
    counsel against your people&quot; (Psalm 83:3). Though there may be a private 
    grudge between such as are wicked—yet they will all agree and unite against 
    the saints. If two greyhounds are snarling at a bone and you put a hare 
    between them, they will leave the bone and chase the hare. So if wicked men 
    have private differences among themselves, and the godly are near them, they 
    will leave snarling at one another and chase the godly. Now, when God's 
    people have so many enemies abroad, who watch for their halting and are glad 
    when they can do them a mischief, shall the saints fall out and divide into 
    parties among themselves?</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">(3) Not to love is very UNSEASONABLE. </b></font>God's 
    people are in a common calamity. They all suffer in the cause of the gospel, 
    and for them to disagree is altogether unseasonable. Why does the Lord bring 
    his people together in <i>affliction</i>, except to bring them together in
    <i>affection</i>? Metals will unite in a furnace. If ever Christians unite, 
    it should be in <i>the furnace of affliction</i>. Chrysostom compares 
    affliction to a shepherd's dog, which makes all the sheep run together. 
    God's rod has this loud voice in it: &quot;Love one another.&quot; How unworthy it is 
    when Christians are <i>suffering </i>together, to be then <i>striving </i>
    together.</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">(4) Not to love is very SINFUL.</p>
    </b></font>
    <p align="justify">(a) For saints not to love, is to live in contradiction 
    to Scripture. The apostle is continually plucking this string of love, as if 
    it made the sweetest music in religion: &quot;This commandment have we from him, 
    That he who loves God love his brother also&quot; (1 John 4:21). (See also Romans 
    13:8; Col. 3:14; 1 Peter 1:22; 1 John 3:11). Not to love is to walk contrary 
    to the Word. Can he who goes against the rules of medicine, be a good 
    physician? Can he who goes against the rules of piety, be a good Christian?</p>
    <p align="justify">(b) Lack of love among Christians greatly silences the 
    spirit of prayer. Hot passions make cold prayers. Where animosities and 
    contentions prevail, instead of praying for one another, Christians will be 
    ready to pray against one another, like the disciples who prayed for fire 
    from heaven on the Samaritans (Luke 9:54). And will God, do you think, hear 
    such prayers as come from a wrathful heart? Will he eat our <i>leavened </i>
    bread? Will he accept those duties which are soured with bitterness of 
    spirit? Shall that prayer which is offered with the strange fire of our 
    sinful passions, ever go up as incense?</p>
    <p align="justify">(c) These heart-burnings hinder the progress of piety in 
    our own souls. The <i>flower of grace</i> will not grow in a <i>wrathful 
    heart</i>. The body may as soon thrive, while it has the plague—as a soul 
    can thrive, which is infected with malice. While Christians are <i>debating</i>, 
    grace is <i>abating</i>. As the spleen grows, health decays. As <i>hatred
    </i>increases, <i>holiness </i>declines.</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">(5) Not to love is very FATAL. </b></font>The differences 
    among God's people portend ruin. All mischiefs come in at this gap of 
    division (Matt. 12:25). Animosities among saints may make God leave his 
    temple: &quot;the glory of the Lord went up from the cherub, and stood upon the 
    threshold&quot; (Ezek. 10:4). Does not God seem to stand upon the threshold of 
    his house, as if he were taking wings to fly? And woe to us if God departs 
    from us (Hos. 9:12)! If the master leaves the ship, it is nearly sinking 
    indeed. If God leaves a land, it must of necessity sink in ruin.</p>

    <p align="justify">Question: How shall we attain this excellent grace of 
    love?</p>

    them one heart, and one way&quot; (Jer. 32:39). Let us pray that there may be no

    antipathies be reconciled? To hate the holy children of God, is a brand of 
    the reprobate. Those who malign the godly, are the curse of creation. If all 
    the scalding drops from God's vial will make them miserable—they shall be 
    so! Never did any who were the haters and persecutors of saints thrive at 
    that trade. What became of Julian, Diocletian, Maximinus, Valerian, Cardinal 
    Crescentius and others? They are standing monuments of God's vengeance! 
    &quot;Calamity will surely overtake the wicked, and those who hate the righteous

    <p align="justify">19. A godly man does not indulge in any SIN</p>
    </b></font></h2>
    <p align="justify">Though sin lives in him—yet he does not live in sin. A 
    godly man may <i>step </i>into sin through infirmity—but he does not <i>keep
    </i>on that road. He prays, &quot;Search me, O God, and know my heart; test me 
    and know my thoughts. Point out anything in me that offends you, and lead me 
    along the path of everlasting life.&quot; (Psalm 139:23-24).</p>
    <i>
    <p align="justify">Question:</i> What is it to indulge sin?</p>
    <i>
    <p align="justify">Answer</i> 1: To give the breast to it and feed it. As a 
    fond parent humors his child and lets him have what he wants, so to indulge 
    sin is to humor sin.</p>
    <i>
    <p align="justify">Answer</i> 2: To indulge sin is to commit it with 
    delight. The ungodly &quot;delight in wickedness&quot; (2 Thess. 2:12).</p>
    <p align="justify">In this sense, a godly man does not indulge sin. Though 
    sin is in him, he is troubled at it and would gladly get rid of it. There is 
    as much difference between sin in the wicked and sin in the godly—as between 
    poison being in a serpent and poison being in a man. Poison in a serpent is 
    in its natural place and is delightful—but poison in a man's body is harmful 
    and he uses antidotes to expel it. So sin in a wicked man is delightful, 
    being in its natural place—but sin in a child of God is burdensome and he 
    uses all means to expel it. The sin is trimmed off. The will is against it. 
    A godly man enters his protest against sin: &quot;Oh, what a miserable person I 
    am! Who will free me from this life that is dominated by sin?&quot; (Romans 
    7:24). A child of God, while he commits sin, hates the sin he commits 
    (Romans 7). </p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">In particular there are four kinds of sin, which a godly 
    man will not allow himself:</p>
    </b></font><font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">1. SECRET sins.</b></font> Some are more modest than to 
    commit open gross sin. That would be a stain on their reputation. But they 
    will sit brooding upon sin in a corner: &quot;Saul secretly practiced mischief&quot; 
    (1 Sam. 23:9). All will not sin on a balcony—but perhaps they will sin 
    behind the curtain. Rachel did not carry her father's images like a saddle 
    cloth to be exposed to public view—but she put them under her and sat on 
    them (Gen. 31:34). Many carry their sins secretly.</p>
    <p align="justify">But a godly man dare not sin secretly:</p>
    <p align="justify">(1) He knows that God sees in secret, &quot;for he knows the 
    secrets of every heart.&quot; (Psalm 44:21). As God cannot be deceived by our 
    subtlety, so he cannot be excluded by our secrecy.</p>
    <p align="justify">(2) A godly man knows that secret sins are in some sense 
    worse than others. They reveal more guile and atheism. The curtain-sinner 
    makes himself believe that God does not see: &quot;Son of man, have you seen what 
    the leaders of Israel are doing with their idols in <i>dark </i>rooms? They 
    are saying—The Lord doesn't see us!&quot; (Ezek. 8:12). Those who have bad eyes 
    think that the sun is dim. How it provokes God, that men's atheism should 
    give the lie to his omniscience! &quot;He who formed the eye, shall he not see?&quot; 
    (Psalm 94:9).</p>
    <p align="justify">(3) A godly man knows that secret sins shall not escape 
    God's justice. A judge on the bench can punish no offence but what is proved 
    by witnesses. He cannot punish the treason of the heart—but the sins of the 
    heart are as visible to God as if they were written upon the forehead. As 
    God will reward secret duties, so he will revenge secret sins.</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">2. GAINFUL sins.</b></font> Gain is the golden bait, with 
    which Satan fishes for souls! &quot;The sweet smell of money.&quot; This was the last 
    temptation he used with Christ: &quot;All these things will I give you&quot; (Matt. 
    4:9). But Christ saw the hook under the bait. Many who have escaped gross 
    sins, are still caught in a <i>golden net. </i>To gain the world, they will 
    use indirect routes.</p>
    <p align="justify">A godly man dare not travel for riches along the devil's 
    highway. Those are sad gains, which make a man lose peace of conscience and 
    heaven at last. He who gets an estate by injustice stuffs his pillow with 
    thorns, and his head will lie very uneasy when he comes to die. &quot;What good 
    will it be for a man if he gains the whole world, yet forfeits his soul?&quot; 
    Matthew 16:26.</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">3. A beloved BESETTING sin.</b></font> &quot;Let us throw off 
    everything that hinders and <i>the sin that so easily entangles</i>, and let 
    us run with perseverance the race marked out for us.&quot; Hebrews 12:1. There is 
    usually one sin that is the favorite—the sin which the heart is most fond 
    of. A beloved sin lies in a man's bosom as the disciple whom Jesus loved, 
    leaned on his bosom (John 13:23). A godly man will not indulge a darling 
    sin: &quot;I kept myself from <i>my </i>iniquity&quot; (Psalm 18:23). &quot;I will not 
    indulge the sin of my constitution, to which the bias of my heart more 
    naturally inclines.&quot; &quot;Fight neither with small nor great—but only with the 
    king&quot; (1 Kings 22:31). A godly man fights this king sin. The oracle of 
    Apollo answered the people of Cyrrha that if they would live in peace among 
    themselves, they must make continual war with those strangers who were on 
    their borders. If we would have peace in our souls, we must maintain a war 
    against our favorite sin and never leave off until it is subdued.</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">Question: How shall we know what our beloved sin is?</p>
    </b></font><b>
    <p align="justify">Answer 1:</b> The sin which a man does not love to have 
    reproved is the <i>darling </i>sin. Herod could not endure having his incest 
    spoken against. If the prophet meddles with that sin—it shall cost him his 
    head! &quot;Do not touch my Herodias!&quot; Men can be content to have other sins 
    reproved—but if the minister puts his finger on the sore, and touches this 
    sin—their hearts begin to burn in malice against him!</p>
    <b>
    <p align="justify">Answer 2: </b>The sin on which the thoughts run most, is 
    the darling sin. Whichever way the <i>thoughts </i>go, the <i>heart </i>
    goes. He who is in love with a person cannot keep his thoughts off that 
    person. Examine what sin runs most in your mind, what sin is first in your 
    thoughts and greets you in the morning—that is your <i>predominant </i>sin.</p>
    <b>
    <p align="justify">Answer 3: </b>The sin which has most power over us, and 
    most easily leads us captive, is the one beloved by the soul. There are some 
    sins which a man can better resist. If they come for entertainment, he can 
    more easily put them off. But the bosom sin comes as a suitor, and he cannot 
    deny it—but is overcome by it. The young man in the Gospel had repulsed many 
    sins—but there was one sin which soiled him, and that was covetousness. 
    Christians, mark what sin you are most readily led captive by—that is <i>the 
    harlot in your bosom! </i>It is a sad thing that a man should be so 
    bewitched by lust, that if it asks him to part with not only half the 
    kingdom (Esther 7:2) but the whole kingdom of heaven, he must part with it, 
    to gratify that lust!</p>
    <b>
    <p align="justify">Answer 4: </b>The sin which men use arguments to defend, 
    is the beloved sin. He who has<i> a jewel in his bosom, </i>will defend it 
    to his death. So when there is any sin in the bosom, men will defend it. The 
    sin we advocate and dispute for, is the besetting sin. If the sin is anger, 
    we plead for it: &quot;I do well to be angry&quot; (Jonah 4:9). If the sin is <i>
    covetousness </i>and we vindicate it and perhaps wrest Scripture to justify 
    it—that is the sin which lies nearest the heart.</p>
    <b>
    <p align="justify">Answer 5:</b> The sin which most troubles us, and flies 
    most in the face in an hour of sickness and distress, that is the <i>Delilah 
    sin! </i>When Joseph's brethren were distressed, their sin in selling their 
    brother came to remembrance: &quot;We are truly guilty concerning our brother . . 
    . therefore is this distress come upon us&quot; (Gen. 42:21). So, when a man is 
    on a sickbed and conscience says, &quot;You have been guilty of such a sin; you 
    went on in it, and rolled it like honey under your tongue!&quot; Conscience is 
    reading him a sad lecture. That was the beloved sin for sure.</p>
    <b>
    <p align="justify">Answer 6: </b>The sin which a man finds most difficulty 
    in giving up, is the endeared sin. Of all his sons, Jacob found most 
    difficulty in parting with Benjamin. So the sinner says, &quot;This and that sin 
    I have parted with—but must Benjamin go, must I part with this delightful 
    sin? That pierces my heart!&quot; As with a castle that has several forts about 
    it, the first and second fort are taken—but when it comes to the <i>castle</i>, 
    the governor will rather fight and die than yield that. So a man may allow 
    some of his sins to be demolished—but when it comes to one sin, that is the 
    taking of the castle; he will never agree to part with that! That is the 
    master sin for sure.</p>
    <p align="justify">The besetting sin is a God-provoking sin. The wise men of 
    Troy counseled Priam to send Helena back to the Greeks, not permitting 
    himself to be abused any longer by the charms of her beauty, because keeping 
    her within the city would lay the foundation of a fatal war. So we should 
    put away our Delilah sin, lest it incense the God of heaven, and make him 
    commence a war against us.</p>
    <p align="justify">The besetting sin is, of all others, most dangerous. As 
    Samson's strength lay in his hair, so the strength of sin, lies in this 
    beloved sin. This is like a poison striking the heart, which brings death. A 
    godly man will lay the <i>axe of repentance </i>to this sin and hew it down! 
    He sets this sin, like Uriah, in the forefront of the battle, so that it may 
    be slain. He will sacrifice this Isaac, he will pluck out this right eye, so 
    that he may see better to go to heaven.</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">4. Those sins which the world counts LESSER.</b></font> 
    There is no such thing as little sin—yet some may be deemed less 
    comparatively. But a godly man will not indulge himself in these. Such as:</p>
    <p align="justify">(1) Sins of omission. Some think it no great matter to 
    omit family, or private prayer. They can go for several months and God never 
    hears from them. A godly man will as soon live without food, as without 
    prayer. He knows that every creature of God is sanctified by prayer (1 Tim. 
    4:5). The bird may shame many Christians; it never takes a drop—but the eye 
    is lifted up towards heaven.</p>
    <p align="justify">(2) A godly man dares not allow himself vain, frothy 
    discourse, much less that which looks like an oath. If God will judge for 
    idle <i>words</i>, will he not much more for idle <i>oaths</i>?</p>
    <p align="justify">(3) A godly man dare not allow himself rash censuring. 
    Some think this a small matter. They will not <i>swear</i>—but they will <i>
    slander</i>. This is very evil. This is wounding a man in that which is 
    dearest to him. He who is godly turns all his censures upon <i>himself!</i> 
    He judges himself for his own sins—but is very watchful and concerned, about 
    the good name of another.</p>
    <font COLOR="#0000ff"><b>
    <p align="justify">Use: </b></font>As you would be numbered among the 
    genealogies of the saints, do not indulge yourselves in any sin. <b>Consider 
    the mischief which <i>one sin lived in, </i>will do:</p>
    </b>
    <p align="justify">1. <i>One sin lived in, gives Satan as much advantage 
    against you as more sins</i>. The fowler can hold a bird by one wing. Satan 
    held Judas fast by one sin.</p>
    <p align="justify">2. <i>One sin lived in, proves that the heart is not 
    sound</i>. He who hides one rebel in his house is a traitor to the crown. 
    The person who indulges one sin is a traitorous hypocrite.</p>
    <p align="justify">3. <i>One sin lived in, will make way for more</i>, as a 
    little thief can open the door to more. Sins are linked and chained 
    together. One sin will draw on more. David's adultery made way for murder. 
    One sin never goes alone! If there is only one <i>nest egg</i>—the devil can 
    brood on it.</p>
    <p align="justify">4. <i>One sin lived in, is as much a breach of God's law 
    as more sins.</i> &quot;Whoever keeps the entire law, yet fails in one point, is 
    guilty of breaking it all&quot; (Jas. 2:10). The king may make a law against 
    felony, treason and murder. If a man is guilty of only one of these, he is a 
    transgressor.</p>
    <p align="justify">5. <i>One sin lived in, prevents Christ from entering</i>. 
    One stone in the pipe keeps out the water. One sin indulged in, obstructs 
    the soul and keeps the streams of Christ's blood from running into it.</p>
    <p align="justify">6. <i>One sin lived in, will spoil all your good duties</i>. 
    A drop of poison will spoil a glass of wine. Abimelech, a bastard-son, 
    destroyed seventy of his brethren (Judges 9:5). One bastard-sin will destroy 
    seventy prayers. One dead fly will spoil the whole box of precious ointment.</p>
    <p align="justify">7. <i>One sin lived in will be a cankerworm to eat out 
    the peace of conscience</i>. It takes away the <i>manna </i>from the ark, 
    and leaves only a <i>rod</i>. &quot;Alas! What a scorpion lies within!&quot; (Seneca). 
    One sin is a <i>pirate—</i>to rob a Christian of his comfort. One jarring 
    string puts all the music out of tune. One sin lived in—will spoil the music 
    of conscience.</p>
    <p align="justify">8. <i>One sin lived in, will damn as well as more sins.</i> 
    One <i>disease </i>is enough to kill. If a <i>fence </i>is made ever so 
    strong, and only one gap is left open; the wild beast may enter and tread 
    down the corn. If only one sin is allowed in the soul, you leave open a gap 
    for the devil to enter! A <i>soldier </i>may have only one gap in his 
    armor--and the bullet may enter there. He may as well be shot there--as if 
    he had no armor on at all. So if you favor only one sin, you leave a part of 
    your soul unprotected--and the bullet of God's wrath may enter there—and 
    shoot you! One sin lived in, may shut you out of heaven! What difference is 
    there, between being shut out of heaven for one sin--or for many sins? One 
    millstone will sink a man into the sea--as well as a hundred!</p>
    <p align="justify">9. <i>One sin harbored in the soul will unfit us for 
    suffering</i>. How soon an hour of trial may come. A man who has hurt his 
    shoulder cannot carry a heavy burden, and a man who has any guilt in his 
    conscience cannot carry the cross of Christ. Will he who cannot deny his <i>
    lust </i>for Christ—deny his <i>life </i>for Christ? <i>One unmortified sin 
    in the soul</i>—will bring forth the bitter fruit of apostasy.</p>
    <p align="justify">If, then, you would show yourselves godly, give a 
    certificate of divorce to every sin. Kill the Goliath sin! &quot;Let not sin

    you.&quot; Grace and sin may be together—but grace and <i>the love of sin cannot</i>. 
    Therefore parley with sin no longer—but with the <i>spear of mortification</i>, 
    spill the heart-blood of every sin! &quot;For if you live after the flesh, you 
    shall die: but if you through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, 
    you shall live.&quot; Romans 8:13. &quot;So put to death the sinful, earthly things

    <p align="justify">20. A godly man is good in his relationships</p>
    </b></font></h2>
    <p align="justify">To be good in general is not enough—but we must show 
    piety in our relationships.</p>
    <font COLOR="#0000ff"><b>
    <p align="justify">1. He who is good as a MAGISTRATE is godly. </b></font>
    The magistrate is God's representative. A godly magistrate holds the balance 
    of justice, and gives everyone his right: &quot;You must never twist justice or 
    show partiality. Never accept a bribe, for bribes blind the eyes of the wise 
    and corrupt the decisions of the godly&quot; (Deut. 16:19). A magistrate must 
    judge the <i>cause</i>, not the <i>person</i>. He who allows himself to be 
    corrupted by bribes, is not a <i>judge </i>but a <i>party</i>. A magistrate 
    must do that which is &quot;according to law&quot; (Acts 23:3). And in order that he 
    may do justice, he must examine the cause. The archer who wishes to shoot 
    right, must first see the target.</p>
    <font COLOR="#0000ff"><b>
    <p align="justify">2. He who is good as a MINISTER is godly.</b></font> 
    Ministers must be:</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">(1) Painstaking.</b></font> &quot;Preach the Word; be prepared 
    in season and out of season; correct, rebuke and encourage--with great 
    patience and careful instruction&quot; (2 Tim. 4:2). The minister must not be 
    idle. Sloth is as inexcusable in a minister, as sleeping in a sentry. John 
    the Baptist was a &quot;voice <i>crying</i>&quot; (Matt. 3:3). A <i>dumb minister</i> 
    is of no more use, than a <i>dead physician</i>. A man of God must <i>work
    </i>in the Lord's vineyard. It was Augustine's wish that Christ might find 
    him at his coming either praying or preaching.</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">(2) Knowledgeable.</b></font> &quot;For the lips of a priest 
    ought to preserve knowledge, and from his mouth men should seek 
    instruction--because he is the messenger of the Lord Almighty&quot; (Mal. 2:7). 
    It was said in honor of Gregory Nazianzene that he was an ocean of divinity. 
    The prophets of old were called &quot;seers&quot; (1 Sam. 9:9). It is absurd to have 
    blind <i>seers</i>. Christ said to Peter, &quot;Feed my sheep&quot; (John 21:16). But 
    how sad it is when the shepherd needs to be fed! Ignorance in a minister is 
    like blindness in an optometrist. Under the law, he who had the plague in 
    his <i>head, </i>was unclean (Lev. 13:44).</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">(3) A plain preacher</b></font>, suiting his matter and 
    style to the capacity of his audience (1 Cor. 14:19). Some ministers, like 
    eagles, love to soar aloft in abstruse metaphysical notions, thinking they 
    are most admired when they are least understood. They who preach in the 
    clouds, instead of hitting their people's conscience, shoot over their 
    heads.</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">(4) Zealous in reproving sin</b></font>. &quot;Rebuke them 
    sharply&quot; (Titus 1:13). Epiphanius said of Elijah, that he sucked fire out of 
    his mother's breasts. <i>A man of God must suck the fire of zeal out of the 
    breasts of Scripture! </i>Zeal in a minister is as proper as fire on the 
    altar. Some are afraid to reprove, like the swordfish which has a sword in 
    his head, but is without a heart. So they carry the sword of the Spirit with 
    them—but have no heart to draw it out in reproof against sin. How many have 
    sown pillows under their people (Ezek. 13:18), making them sleep so 
    securely, that they never awoke until they were in hell!</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">(5) Holy in heart and life:</p>
    </b></font><font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">(a) In heart.</b></font> How sad it is for a minister to 
    preach that to others, which he never felt in his own soul; to exhort others 
    to holiness and himself be a stranger to it. Oh, that this were not too 
    often so! How many blow the Lord's trumpet with foul breath!</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">(b) In life.</b></font> Under the law, before the priests
    <i>served </i>at the altar, they <i>washed </i>in the laver. Such as serve 
    in the Lord's house must first be washed from gross sin in the laver of 
    repentance. The life of a minister should be a walking Bible. Basil said of 
    Gregory Nazianzene that he thundered in his doctrine, and lightened in his 
    conduct. A minister must imitate John the Baptist, who was not only &quot;a voice 
    crying&quot;—but &quot;a light shining&quot; (John 5:35). Those who live in contradiction 
    to what they preach, disgrace this excellent calling. And though they are 
    angels by office—yet they are devils in their lives (Jer. 23:15).</p>
    <font COLOR="#0000ff"><b>
    <p align="justify">3. He who is good as a HUSBAND is godly. </b></font>He 
    fills up that relationship with love: &quot;Husbands, love your wives&quot; (Eph. 
    5:25). The vine twisting its branches about the elm and embracing it may be 
    an emblem of that entire love which should be in the marital relationship. A 
    married condition would be sad--if it had cares to embitter it and not love 
    to sweeten it. <i>Love is the best diamond in the marriage ring! </i>&quot;Isaac 
    loved Rebekah&quot; (Gen. 24:67). Unkindnesses in this close relationship are 
    very unhappy. We read in heathen authors that Clytemnestra, the wife of 
    Agamemnon, in order to revenge an injury received from her husband, first 
    rent the veil of her chastity and afterwards consented to his death. The 
    husband should show his love to his wife by covering infirmities; by 
    avoiding occasions of strife; by sweet, endearing expressions; by pious 
    counsel; by love tokens; by encouraging what he sees amiable and virtuous in 
    her; by mutual prayer; by being with her, unless detained by urgency of 
    business. The pilot who leaves his ship and abandons it entirely to the 
    merciless waves, declares that he does not value it or reckon there is any 
    treasure in it.</p>
    <p align="justify">The apostle gives a good reason why there should be 
    mutual love between husband and wife: &quot;that your prayers be not hindered&quot; (1 
    Pet. 3:7). Where anger and bitterness prevail, there prayer is either 
    intermitted or interrupted.</p>
    <font COLOR="#0000ff"><b>
    <p align="justify">4. He who is good as a FATHER is godly</p>
    </b></font>
    <p align="justify">(1) A father must drop holy instructions into his 
    children: &quot;bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord&quot; (Eph. 
    6:4). This is what Abraham did: &quot;I know Abraham, that he will command his 
    children and his household, and they shall keep the way of the Lord&quot; (Gen. 
    18:19). Children are young plants which must be watered with good education, 
    so that they may, with Obadiah, fear the Lord &quot;from their youth up&quot; (1 Kings 
    18:12). Plato said, &quot;In vain does he expect a harvest, who has been 
    negligent in sowing.&quot; Nor can a parent expect to reap any good from a child, 
    where he has not sown the seed of wholesome instruction. And though, 
    notwithstanding all counsel and admonition, the child should die in sin—yet 
    it is a comfort to a godly parent to think that before his child died, he 
    gave it <i>spiritual medicine</i>.</p>
    <p align="justify">(2) A parent must pray for his children. Monica, the 
    mother of Augustine, prayed for his conversion, and someone said &quot;it was 
    impossible that a son of so many prayers and tears should perish.&quot; The soul 
    of your child is in a trap--and will you not pray that it may &quot;escape from 
    the Devil's trap?&quot; (2 Tim. 2:26) Many parents are careful to lay up <i>
    portions </i>for their children—but they do not lay up <i>prayers </i>for 
    them.</p>
    <p align="justify">(3) A parent must give his children discipline: &quot;Do not 
    withhold discipline from a child; if you punish him with the rod, he will 
    not die. Punish him with the rod and save his soul from death&quot; (Proverbs 
    23:13-14). The rod beats out the <i>dust </i>and <i>moth </i>of sin. A child 
    indulged and humored in wickedness, will prove a <i>burden </i>instead of a
    <i>blessing</i>. David pampered Adonijah: &quot;his father had never disciplined 
    him at any time&quot; (1 Kings 1:6). And afterwards he was a grief of heart to 
    his father, and wanted to put him off his throne. Discipline is a hedge of 
    thorns--to stop children in their mad race to hell.</p>
    <font COLOR="#0000ff"><b>
    <p align="justify">5. He who is good as a MASTER is godly</p>
    </b></font>
    <p align="justify">A godly man promotes true religion in his family; he sets 
    up piety in his house, as well as in his heart: &quot;I will walk within my house 
    with a perfect heart&quot; (Psalm 101:2). &quot;I and my household will serve the 
    Lord&quot; (Josh. 24:15). I find it written in honor of Cramer, that his family 
    was a <i>nursery of piety</i>. A godly man's house is a <i>little church</i>: 
    &quot;the church which is in his house&quot; (Col. 4:15).</p>
    <p align="justify">(1) A good man makes known the oracles of God to those 
    who are under his roof. He reads the Word and perfumes his house with 
    prayer. It is recorded of the Jews, that they had sacrifices in their family 
    as well as in the tabernacle (Exod. 12:3).</p>
    <p align="justify">(2) A godly man provides necessities. He relieves his 
    servants in health and sickness. He is not like that Amalekite who shook off 
    his servant when he was sick, (1 Sam. 30:13)—but rather like the good 
    centurion, who sought Christ for the healing of his sick servant (Matt. 
    8:5).</p>
    <p align="justify">(3) A godly man sets his servants a good example. He is 
    sober and heavenly in his deportment; his virtuous life is a good <i>mirror
    </i>for the servants in the family to dress themselves by.</p>
    <font COLOR="#0000ff"><b>
    <p align="justify">6. He who is good in the relationship of a CHILD is godly</p>
    </b></font>
    <p align="justify">He honors his parents. Philo the Jew, placed the fifth 
    commandment in the first table—as if children had not performed their whole 
    devotion to God until they had given honor to their parents. This honoring 
    of parents consists in two things:</p>
    <p align="justify">(1) In <i>respecting </i>them--which respect is shown 
    both by <i>humility </i>of speech and by attitude. The opposite of this is 
    when a child behaves himself in an unseemly and proud manner. Among the 
    Lacedemonians, if a child had behaved rebelliously towards his parent, it 
    was lawful for the father to appoint someone else to be his heir, and to 
    disinherit that child.</p>
    <p align="justify">(2) Obeying their commands: &quot;Children, obey your parents 
    in the Lord&quot; (Eph. 6:1). Duty is the <i>interest </i>which children pay 
    their parents, on the <i>capital </i>they have had from them. Christ has set 
    all children a pattern of obedience to their parents: &quot;He was subject unto 
    them&quot; (Luke 2:51). The Rechabites were eminent for this: &quot;I set cups and 
    jugs of wine before them and invited them to have a drink, but they refused. 
    &quot;No,&quot; they said. &quot;We don't drink wine, because Jehonadab our ancestor, gave 
    us this command: You and your descendants must never drink wine&quot; (Jer. 
    35:5,6). Solon was asked why, among the many laws he made, none was against 
    disobedient children. He answered that it was because he thought none would 
    be so wicked.</p>
    <p align="justify">God has punished children who have refused to pay the 
    tribute of obedience. Absalom, a disobedient son, was hanged in an oak 
    between heaven and earth, as being worthy of neither. Manlius, an old man, 
    being reduced to much poverty, and having a rich son, entreated him only for 
    charity—but could not obtain it. The son disowned him as his father, using 
    reproachful language. The poor old man let tears fall (as witnesses of his 
    grief) and went away. God, to revenge this disobedience of his son, soon 
    afterwards struck him with madness. He in whose heart godliness lives, makes 
    as much conscience of the fifth commandment as of the first.</p>
    <font COLOR="#0000ff"><b>
    <p align="justify">7. He who is good as a SERVANT is godly</p>
    </b></font>
    <p align="justify">&quot;Obey your earthly masters in everything; and do it, not 
    only when their eye is on you and to win their favor, but with sincerity of 
    heart and reverence for the Lord.&quot; (Col. 3:22; Eph. 6:5). The goodness of 
    servants lies in:</p>
    <p align="justify">(1) <i>Diligence</i>. Abraham's servant quickly 
    dispatched the business his master entrusted him with (Gen. 24:33).</p>
    <p align="justify">(2) <i>Cheerfulness</i>. Servants must be cheerful 
    workers, like the centurion's servants: &quot;If I say to one, 'Go,' he goes&quot; 
    (Luke 7:8).</p>
    <p align="justify">(3) <i>Faithfulness</i>, which consists in two things:
    </p>
    <p align="justify">(a) In not defrauding. &quot;Not stealing&quot; (Titus 2:10). </p>
    <p align="justify">(b) In keeping counsel. It proves the badness of a 
    stomach, when it cannot retain what is put into it, and the badness of a 
    servant when he cannot retain those secrets which his master has committed 
    to him.</p>
    <p align="justify">(4) <i>Submissiveness.</i> &quot;Be submissive to their 
    masters in everything, and to be well-pleasing, not talking back&quot; (Titus 
    2:9). It is better to correct a fault than to minimize it. And what may 
    stimulate a servant in his work is that encouraging scripture, &quot;Work hard 
    and cheerfully at whatever you do, as though you were working for the Lord 
    rather than for people. Remember that the Lord will give you an inheritance 
    as your reward, and the Master you are serving is Christ.&quot; (Col. 3:24). If 
    Christ should bid you do a piece of work for him, would you not do it? While 
    you serve your master, you serve the Lord Christ. If you ask what salary you 
    shall have, &quot;the Lord will give you an inheritance as your reward.&quot; </p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">Use 1:</b></font> Is it the grand sign of a godly man to 
    be holy in his relationships? Then the Lord be merciful to us. How few godly 
    ones are to be found! Many put on the <i>coat of profession</i>. They will 
    pray and discourse on points of religion—but &quot;What means this bleating of 
    the sheep?&quot; (1 Sam. 15:14). They are not good in their relationships. How 
    bad it is when Christians are defective in family piety! </p>
    <p align="justify">Can we call a bad <b>magistrate</b>, godly? He perverts 
    equity: &quot;Justice—do you rulers know the meaning of the word? Do you judge 
    the people fairly? No, all your dealings are crooked; you hand out violence 
    instead of justice&quot; (Psalm 58:1,2). Can we call a bad <b>parent</b>, godly? 
    He never teaches his child the way to heaven. He is like the ostrich which 
    is cruel to her young (Job 39:16). Can we call a bad <b>employer</b>, godly? 
    Many employers leave their religion at church (as the clerk does his book). 
    They have nothing of God at home; their houses are not Bethels—but Bethavens—not 
    little <i>temples </i>but little <i>hells</i>. How many employers at the 
    last day must plead guilty at the bar. Though they have fed their servants' 
    bellies, they have starved their souls. Can we call a bad <b>child</b>, 
    godly? He stops his ear to his parents' counsel. You may as well call him 
    who is disloyal--a good subject. Can we call a bad <b>servant</b>, godly? He 
    is slothful and wilful; he is more ready to spy a fault in another than to 
    correct it in himself. To call one who is bad in his relationships godly, is 
    a contradiction; it is to call evil good (Isaiah 5:20).</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">Use 2:</b></font> As we desire to have God approve of us, 
    let us show godliness in our relationships. Not to be good in our 
    relationships spoils all our other good things. Naaman was an honorable man—<i>but</i> 
    he was a leper (2 Kings 5:1). That &quot;but&quot; spoiled everything. So such a 
    person is a great hearer—<i>but</i> he neglects relative duties. This stains 
    the beauty of all his other actions. As in printing, though the letter is 
    ever so well shaped—yet if it is not set in the right place, it spoils the 
    sense. So let a man have many things commendable in him—yet if he is not 
    good in his right place, making conscience of how he walks in his 
    relationships, he does harm to religion. There are many to whom Christ will 
    say at last, as to the young man, &quot;There is still one thing you lack&quot; (Luke 
    18:22). You have misbehaved in your relative capacity. As therefore we 
    cherish our salvation and the honor of true religion, let us shine in that 
    orb of relationships where God has placed us.</p>
    <h2><p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
    <font COLOR="#ff0000"><b>
    <p align="justify">21. A godly man does spiritual things in a spiritual 
    manner</p>
    </b></font></h2>
    <p align="justify">&quot;We are the true circumcision, who worship God in the 
    spirit&quot; (Phil. 3:3). Spiritual worship is pure worship: &quot;You are built up a 
    spiritual house, a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices&quot; (1 
    Peter 2:5)—spiritual not only in the matter—but also in the quality. A 
    wicked man either lives in the total neglect of duty--or else discharges it 
    in a dull, careless manner. Instead of &quot;using the world as if he used it 
    not&quot; (1 Cor. 7.31), he serves God as if he did not serve him. A godly man 
    spiritualizes duty; he is not only for the doing of holy things--but for the
    <i>holy doing</i> of things.</p>
    <i>
    <p align="justify">Question:</i> What is it to perform spiritual duties 
    spiritually?</p>
    <i>
    <p align="justify">Answer:</i> It consists in three things:</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">1. To do duties from a spiritual principle, namely, a 
    renewed principle of grace. </b></font>A man may have gifts which attract 
    admiration; he may have the most melting, ravishing expressions; he may 
    speak like an angel come down from heaven; yet his duties may not be 
    spiritual because he lacks the grace of the Spirit. Whatever a moral, 
    unregenerate person does--is only <i>nature refined</i>. Though he may do 
    duties better than a godly man—yet not so well—better as to the matter and 
    elegance—yet not so well, as lacking a renewed principle. A crab-tree may 
    bear as well as an apple tree; the fruit may be big and lovelier to the 
    eye—yet it is not such good fruit as the other, because it does not come 
    from so good a stock. So an unregenerate person may perform as many duties 
    as a child of God, and these may seem to be more glorious to the outward 
    view—but they are harsh and sour, because they do not come from the sweet 
    and pleasant root of grace. A true saint gives God that wine, which comes 
    from the pure grape of the Spirit.</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">2. To perform duties spiritually is to do them with the 
    utmost intention.</b></font> A Christian is very serious and strives to keep 
    his thoughts close to the work in hand: &quot;that you may attend upon the Lord 
    without distraction&quot; (1 Cor. 7:35).</p>
    <i>
    <p align="justify">Question:</i> But may not a godly man have roving 
    thoughts in duty?</p>
    <i>
    <p align="justify">Answer:</i> Yes, sad experience proves it. The thoughts 
    will be dancing up and down in prayer. The saints are called <i>stars, </i>
    and many times in duty they are wandering stars. The heart is like 
    quicksilver which will not settle. It is hard to tie two good thoughts 
    together. We cannot lock our hearts so close but that distracting thoughts, 
    like wind, will get in. Jerome complains about himself. &quot;Sometimes,&quot; he 
    says, &quot;when I am doing God's service, I am walking in the galleries or 
    casting up accounts.&quot;</p>
    <p align="justify">But these wandering thoughts in the godly are not 
    allowed: &quot;I <i>hate </i>vain thoughts&quot; (Psalm 119:113). They come like 
    unwelcome guests who are no sooner spied, than they are turned out.</p>
    <b><font COLOR="#b07050">
    <p align="justify">Question: From where do these wandering thoughts arise in 
    the godly?</p>
    </font><i>
    <p align="justify">Answer</i> 1: From the depravity of nature</b>. They are 
    the mud which the heart casts up.</p>
    <b><i>
    <p align="justify">Answer</i> 2: From Satan.</b> The devil, if he cannot 
    hinder us <i>from</i> duty, will hinder us <i>in</i> duty. When we come 
    before the Lord, he is at our right hand to resist us (Zech. 3:1). Like when 
    a man is going to write, and another stands at his elbow and jogs him, so 
    that he cannot write evenly. Satan will set vain objects before the 
    imagination, to cause a diversion. The devil does not oppose <i>formality</i>, 
    but <i>fervency</i>. If he sees that we are setting ourselves in good 
    earnest to seek God, he will be whispering things in our ears, so that we 
    can scarcely attend to what we are doing.</p>
    <b><i>
    <p align="justify">Answer</i> 3: These wandering thoughts arise from the 
    world. </b>These vermin are bred out of the earth. Worldly business often 
    crowds into our duties, and while our <i>mouths </i>are speaking to God, our
    <i>hearts </i>are thinking of the world: &quot;They sit before me as my 
    people—but their <i>heart </i>goes after their covetousness&quot; (Ezek. 33:31). 
    While we are hearing the Word or meditating, some worldly business or other 
    commonly knocks at the door and we are called away from the duty while we 
    are doing it. It is the same with us as it was with Abraham when he was 
    going to worship—the birds came down on the sacrifice (Gen. 15:11).</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">Question: How may we get rid of these wandering thoughts, 
    so that we may be more spiritual in duty?</p>
    </b></font><i>
    <p align="justify">Answer</i> 1: Fix your eyes on God's purity. He whom we 
    serve is a holy God, and when we are worshiping him, he cannot tolerate our 
    conversing with vanity. While a king's subject is speaking to him, will the 
    king like him to be playing with a feather? Will God endure light, feathery 
    hearts? How devout and reverent the angels are! They cover their faces and 
    cry, &quot;Holy, holy.&quot; </p>
    <i>
    <p align="justify">Answer</i> 2: Think of the grand importance of the duties 
    we are engaged in. As David said, concerning his building a house for God, 
    &quot;the work is great&quot; (1 Chron. 29:1). When we are hearing the Word, &quot;the work 
    is great.&quot; This is the Word by which we shall be judged. When we are at 
    prayer, &quot;the work is great.&quot; We are pleading for the life of our souls, and 
    is this a time to trifle?</p>
    <i>
    <p align="justify">Answer</i> 3: Come with delight to duty. The nature of 
    love is to fix the mind upon the object. The thoughts of a man who is in 
    love, are on the person he loves, and nothing can distract them. The 
    thoughts of a man who loves the world are always intent on it. If our hearts 
    were more fired with love, they would be more fixed in duty, and oh, what 
    cause we have to love duty! Is not this the direct road to heaven? Do we not 
    meet with God here? Can the spouse be better than in her husband's company? 
    Where can the soul be better than in drawing near to God?</p>
    <i>
    <p align="justify">Answer</i> 4: Consider the mischief that these vain 
    distracting thoughts do. They blow away our duties; they hinder fervency; 
    they show great irreverence; they tempt God to turn his ear away from us. 
    Why do we think <i>God </i>should heed our prayers--when <i>we </i>ourselves 
    scarcely heed them?</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">3. To do duties spiritually is to do them in faith.</b></font> 
    &quot;By faith Abel offered unto God, a better sacrifice than Cain&quot; (Heb. 11:4). 
    The holy oil for the tabernacle had several spices put into it (Exod. 
    30:34). Faith is the sweet spice which must be put into duty. It is a wrong 
    done to God--to <i>doubt </i>either his mercy or his truth. A Christian may 
    venture his soul upon the promises of God in Scripture.</p>
    <font COLOR="#0000ff"><b>
    <p align="justify">Use 1:</b></font> How far from godliness, are those who 
    are unspiritual in their worship, who do not do duties from a renewed 
    principle and with the utmost intention of soul—but merely to stop the mouth 
    of conscience! Many people look no further than the bare doing of duties—but 
    never heed <i>how </i>they are done. God does not judge our duties by their 
    length—but by love. When men put God off with the dreggish part of duty, may 
    he not say, like Isaiah, &quot;Is it such a fast that I have chosen?&quot; (Isaiah 
    58:5). &quot;Are these the duties I required? I called for the <i>heart </i>and
    <i>spirit--</i>and you bring nothing but the <i>carcass </i>of duty. Should 
    I receive this?&quot; &quot;The Lord says--These people come near to me with their <i>
    mouth </i>and honor me with their <i>lips</i>, but their <i>hearts </i>are 
    far from me.&quot; Isaiah 29:13 </p>
    <font COLOR="#0000ff"><b>
    <p align="justify">Use 2:</b></font> Let us show ourselves godly by being 
    more spiritual in duty. It is not the <i>quantity, </i>but the <i>quality</i>--which 
    God is concerned with. It is not how <i>much </i>we do--but how <i>well</i>. 
    A musician is commended, not for playing long--but for playing well. We must 
    not only do <i>what </i>God appoints--but <i>as </i>God appoints. Oh, how 
    many are unspiritual in spiritual things! They bring their services but not 
    their hearts. They give God the skin, not the fat of the offering. &quot;God is a 
    Spirit&quot; (John 4:24)—and it is the spirituality of duty he is best pleased 
    with: &quot;Spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God&quot; (1 Pet. 2:5). The <i>spirits
    </i>of the wine are best. So is the spiritual part of duty: &quot;making melody 
    in your <i>heart </i>to the Lord&quot; (Eph. 5:19). It is the heart which makes 
    the music; the spiritualizing of duty gives life to it. Without this--it is 
    only dead praying, dead hearing—and dead things are not pleasing. A dead 
    flower has no beauty, a dead breast has no sweetness.</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">Question: What may we do, to perform duties in a 
    spiritual manner?</p>
    </b></font><i>
    <p align="justify">Answer</i> 1: Let the soul be kept pure. Lust besots and 
    dispirits a man. Beware of any tincture of uncleanness (Jas. 1:21). Wood 
    that is full of sap will not easily burn. Just so, a heart steeped in sin is 
    not fit to burn in holy devotion. Can he who feeds carnal lust be spiritual 
    in worship? &quot;Whoredom and wine and new wine take away the heart&quot; (Hos. 
    4:11). Any sin lived in, takes away the heart. Such a person has no heart to 
    pray or meditate. The more alive the heart is in sin, the more it dies to 
    duty.</p>
    <i>
    <p align="justify">Answer</i> 2: If we wish to be spiritual in duty, let us 
    revolve these two things in our mind:</p>
    <p align="justify">(1) The profit which comes from a duty performed in a 
    spiritual manner. It enfeebles corruption; it increases grace; it defeats 
    Satan; it strengthens our communion with God; it breeds peace of conscience; 
    it procures answers of mercy; and it leaves the heart always in better tune.</p>
    <p align="justify">(2) The danger of doing duties in an unspiritual manner. 
    They are as if they had not been done. For what the heart does not do--is 
    not done. Duties carelessly performed, turn <i>ordinances </i>into <i>
    judgments</i>. Therefore many, though they are often doing duty--go away 
    worse from duty! If medicine is not well made and the ingredients rightly 
    mixed, it is as bad as poison for the body. Just so, if duties are not well 
    performed, they leave the heart harder and more sinful than before.</p>
    <p align="justify">Unspiritual duties often create temporal judgments: &quot;the 
    Lord our God made a breach upon us, for that we sought him not after the due 
    order&quot; (1 Chron. 15:13). Therefore God makes breaches in families and 
    relationships, because people do not worship him in that manner and due 
    order which he requires.</p>
    <i>
    <p align="justify">Answer</i> 3: If we want to have our <i>duties </i>
    spiritual, we must get our <i>hearts </i>spiritual. An earthly heart cannot 
    be spiritual in duty. Let us beg from God, a <i>spiritual palate</i> to 
    relish a sweetness in holy things. For lack of spiritual hearts, we come to 
    duty without delight--and go away without profit! If a man wants to have the 
    wheels of his watch move regularly, he must mend the spring. Christian, if 
    you want to move more spiritually in duty, get the <i>spring of your heart
    </i>mended.</p>
    <h2><p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
    <font COLOR="#ff0000"><b>
    <p align="justify">22. A godly man is thoroughly trained in piety</p>
    </b></font></h2>
    <p align="justify">He obeys every command of God: &quot;I have found David a man 
    after my own heart, for he will carry out <i>all </i>My will&quot; (Acts 13:22). 
    In the Greek it is &quot;all my will<i>s</i>.&quot; A godly man strives to walk 
    according to the full breadth and latitude of God's law. Every command has 
    the same stamp of divine authority on it, and he who is godly will obey one 
    command as well as another: &quot;Then shall I not be ashamed, when I have 
    respect to <i>all </i>your commandments&quot; (Psalm 119:6). A godly man goes 
    through all the body of piety--as the sun through all the signs of the 
    Zodiac. Whoever is to play a ten-stringed instrument must strike every 
    string or he will spoil all the music. The ten commandments may be compared 
    to a ten-stringed instrument. We must obey every commandment, strike every 
    string, or we cannot make any sweet music in piety.</p>
    <p align="justify">True obedience is filial. It is fitting that the child 
    should obey the parent in all just and sober commands. God's laws are like 
    the curtains of the tabernacle which were looped together. They are like a 
    chain of gold where all the links are coupled. A godly man will not 
    willingly break one link of this chain. If one command is violated, the 
    whole chain is broken: &quot;whoever shall keep the whole law—yet offend in one 
    point, he is guilty of all&quot; (Jas. 2:10). A voluntary breach of one of God's 
    laws involves a man in the guilt, and exposes him to the curse of the whole 
    law. True obedience is entire and uniform. A good heart, like the needle, 
    points the way in which the loadstone draws.</p>
    <p align="justify">This is one great difference between a child of God and a 
    hypocrite. The hypocrite picks and chooses in religion. He will perform some 
    duties which are easier, and gratify his pride or interest—but other duties 
    he takes no notice of: &quot;Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you 
    hypocrites! You give a tenth of your spices--mint, dill and cummin. But you 
    have neglected the more important matters of the law--justice, mercy and 
    faithfulness&quot; (Matt. 23:23). To sweat in some duties of religion, and freeze 
    in others--is the symptom of a disordered Christian. Jehu was zealous in 
    destroying the idolatry of Baal—but let the golden calves of Jeroboam stand 
    (2 Kings 10:29). This shows that men are not good in truth--when they are 
    good by halves. If your servant should do some of your work you command him, 
    and leave the rest undone, how would you like that? The Lord says, &quot;Walk 
    before me, and be perfect&quot; (Gen. 17:1). How are our hearts perfect with 
    God--when we prevaricate with him? Some things we will do and other things 
    we leave undone. He is godly who is godly universally. &quot;Here I am, Father; 
    command what you will&quot; (<i>Plautus</i>).</p>
    <p align="justify">There are ten duties that God calls for, which a godly 
    man will conscientiously perform, and indeed these duties may serve as so 
    many other characteristics and touchstones to test our godliness by:</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">1. A godly man will often be calling his heart to account</p>
    </b></font>
    <p align="justify">He takes the candle of the Word and searches his 
    innermost being: &quot;I commune with my own heart: and my spirit made diligent 
    search&quot; (Psalm 77:6). A gracious soul searches whether there is any <i>duty
    </i>omitted--or any <i>sin </i>cherished. He examines his evidences for 
    heaven. As he will not take his <i>gold </i>on trust, so neither will he 
    take his <i>grace</i>. He is a spiritual merchant; he casts up the estate of 
    his soul to see what he is worth. He &quot;sets his house in order.&quot;<i> Frequent 
    reckonings keep God and conscience friends. </i>A carnal person cannot abide 
    this heart-work; he is ignorant how the affairs go in his soul. He is like a 
    man who is well acquainted with foreign countries, but a stranger in his own 
    country.</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">2. A godly man is much in private prayer</p>
    </b></font>
    <p align="justify">He keeps his hours for private devotion. Jacob, when he 
    was left alone, wrestled with God (Gen. 32:24). So when a gracious heart is 
    alone, it wrestles in prayer and will not leave God until it has a blessing. 
    A devout Christian <i>exercises '</i>eyes of faith' and 'knees of prayer'.</p>
    <p align="justify">Hypocrites who have nothing of religion besides the 
    frontispiece, love to be <i>seen</i>. Christ has characterized them: &quot;they 
    love to pray in the corners of the streets--that they may be seen&quot; (Matt. 
    6:5). The hypocrite is devout in the temple. There everyone will gaze at 
    him—but he is a stranger to secret communion with God. He is a saint in the 
    church—but an atheist in private. A good Christian holds secret 
    communication with heaven. Private prayer keeps up the trade of godliness. 
    When <i>private </i>holiness is laid aside, a stab is given to the heart of 
    piety.</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">3. A godly man is diligent in his calling</p>
    </b></font>
    <p align="justify">He takes care to provide for his family. The <i>church
    </i>must not exclude the <i>shop</i>. Mr. Perkins said: &quot;Though a man is 
    endued with excellent gifts, hears the Word with reverence and receives the 
    sacrament—yet if he does not practice the duties of his calling--all is 
    sheer hypocrisy.&quot; <i>Piety </i>never did grant a patent for <i>idleness</i>: 
    &quot;We hear that some among you are idle. They are not busy; they are 
    busybodies. Such people we command and urge in the Lord Jesus Christ to 
    settle down and <i>earn </i>the bread they eat.&quot; (2 Thess. 3:11,12). The 
    bread that tastes most <i>sweet</i>--is obtained with most <i>sweat</i>. A 
    godly man would rather fast--than eat the bread of idleness. Vain professing 
    Christians talk of living by faith—but do not live in a calling. They are 
    like the lilies of the field: &quot;they toil not, neither do they spin&quot; (Matt. 
    6:28). <i>An idle person is the devil's tennis ball, which he bandies up and 
    down with temptation until at last the ball goes out of play.</p>
    </i><font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">4. A godly man sets bounds to himself in <i>things lawful
    </p>
    </i></b></font>
    <p align="justify">He is moderate in matters of <b>recreation </b>and <b>
    diet</b>. He takes only so much as is needed for the restoration of health, 
    and as may the better dispose him for God's service. Jerome lived 
    abstemiously; his diet was a few dried figs and cold water. And Augustine in 
    his &quot;Confessions&quot; says: &quot;Lord, you have taught me to go to my <i>food</i>--as 
    to a <i>medicine</i>.&quot; If the <i>bridle of reason</i> checks the appetite, 
    much more should the <i>curbing-bit of grace </i>do so. The life of a sinner 
    is brutish; the glutton feeds &quot;without fear&quot; (Jude 12), and the drunkard 
    drinks without reason. Too much oil chokes the lamp, whereas a smaller 
    quantity makes it burn more brightly. A godly man holds the <i>golden bridle 
    of temperance</i>, and will not allow his table to be a snare.</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">5. A godly man is careful about moral righteousness</p>
    </b></font>
    <p align="justify">He makes conscience of <i>equity </i>as well as <i>piety</i>. 
    The Scripture has linked both together: &quot;that we might serve him in <i>
    holiness </i>and <i>righteousness</i>&quot; (Luke 1:74,75). Holiness: there is 
    the first table of the law; righteousness: there is the second table of the 
    law. Though a man may be morally righteous, and not godly—yet no one can be 
    godly, unless he is morally righteous. This moral righteousness is seen in 
    our dealings with men. A godly man observes that golden maxim, &quot;So in 
    everything, do to others what you would have them do to you&quot; (Matt. 7:12). 
    There is a threefold injustice in business matters:</p>
    <p align="justify">(1) Using false weights: &quot;the balances of deceit are in 
    his hand&quot; (Hos. 12:7). Men, by making their weights lighter, make their sin 
    heavier. &quot;They make the ephah small&quot; (Amos 8:5). The ephah was a measure 
    they used in selling. They made the ephah small; they gave but scant 
    measure. A godly man who takes the Bible in one hand, dare not use false 
    weights in the other.</p>
    <p align="justify">(2) Debasing a commodity: &quot;they sell the refuse of the 
    wheat&quot; (Amos 8:6). They would pick out the best grains of the wheat and sell 
    the worst at the same price as they did the best. &quot;Your wine is <i>mixed </i>
    with water&quot; (Isaiah 1:22). They adulterated their wine—yet made their 
    customers believe it came from the pure grape.</p>
    <p align="justify">(3) Taking a great deal more than the commodity is worth. 
    &quot;If you sell anything unto your neighbor . . . you shall not oppress one 
    another&quot; (Lev. 25:14). A godly man deals exactly but not exactingly. He will 
    sell so as to help himself—but not to harm another. His motto is, &quot;a 
    conscience void of offence toward God, and toward men&quot; (Acts 24:16).</p>
    <p align="justify">The hypocrite separates these two which God has joined 
    together—righteousness and holiness. He pretends to be pure but is not just. 
    It brings piety into contempt, when men hang out Christ's colors—yet will 
    use fraudulent circumvention and, under a mask of piety, neglect morality. A 
    godly man makes conscience of the second table of the law, as well as the 
    first.</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">6. A godly man will forgive those who have wronged him</p>
    </b></font><i>
    <p align="justify">Revenge is sweet to nature</i>. A gracious spirit passes 
    by affronts, forgets injuries and counts it a greater victory to conquer an 
    enemy by <i>patience--</i>than by <i>power</i>. It is truly heroic &quot;to 
    overcome evil with good&quot; (Romans 12:21). Though I would not <i>trust </i>an 
    enemy—yet I would endeavor to <i>love </i>him. I would exclude him from my 
    creed—but not from my prayer (Matt. 5:44).</p>
    <i>
    <p align="justify">Question:</i> But does every godly man succeed in 
    forgiving, yes, loving his enemies?</p>
    <i>
    <p align="justify">Answer: </i>He does so in a gospel sense. That is:</p>
    <p align="justify">(a) In so far as there is assent. He subscribes to it in 
    his judgment as a thing which ought to be done: &quot;with my mind I serve the 
    law of God&quot; (Romans 7:25).</p>
    <p align="justify">(b) In so far as there is grief. A godly man mourns that 
    he can love his enemies no more: &quot;O wretched man that I am!&quot; (Romans 7:24). 
    &quot;Oh, this base cankered heart of mine, that has received so much mercy and 
    can show so little! I have had millions forgiven me—yet I can hardly forgive 
    pence!&quot;</p>
    <p align="justify">(c) In so far as there is prayer. A godly man prays that 
    God will give him a heart to love his enemies. &quot;Lord, pluck this root of 
    bitterness out of me, perfume my soul with love, make me a dove without 
    gall.&quot;</p>
    <p align="justify">(d) In so far as there is effort. A godly man resolves 
    and strives in the strength of Christ against all rancor and virulence of 
    spirit. This is in a gospel sense to love our enemies. A wicked man cannot 
    do this; his malice boils up to revenge.</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">7. A godly man lays to heart the miseries of the church
    </p>
    </b></font>
    <p align="justify">&quot;We wept, when we remembered Zion&quot; (Psalm 137:1). I have 
    read of certain trees whose leaves, if cut or touched, the other leaves 
    begin to contract and shrink, and for a time hang down their heads. Such a 
    spiritual sympathy exists among Christians. When other parts of God's church 
    suffer, they feel it themselves, as it were. Ambrose reports that when 
    Theodosius was terminally ill, he was more troubled about the church of God 
    than about his own sickness. </p>
    <p align="justify">When the Lord strikes others, a godly heart is deeply 
    affected: &quot;my affections shall sound like an harp&quot; (Isaiah 16:11). Though 
    things go well with a child of God in his own private life, and he lives in 
    a house of cedar--he still grieves to see things go badly with the public. 
    Queen Esther enjoyed the king's favor and all the delights of the court—yet 
    when a warrant portending bloodshed was signed for the death of the 
    Jews--she mourns and fasts, and ventures her own life to save theirs.</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">8. A godly man is content with his present condition</p>
    </b></font>
    <p align="justify">If provisions get low, his heart is tempered to his 
    condition. A godly man puts a kind interpretation upon providence. When God 
    brews him a bitter cup, he says, &quot;This is my <i>medicine cup</i>--it is to 
    purge me and do my soul good.&quot; Therefore he is most content (Phil. 4:11).</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">9. A godly man is fruitful in good works</b></font> 
    (Titus 2:7)</p>
    <p align="justify">The Hebrew word for godly (<i>chasid</i>) signifies 
    &quot;merciful&quot;, implying that to be godly and charitable are of equal force--one 
    and the same. A good man feeds the hungry, clothes the naked. &quot;He is ever 
    merciful&quot; (Psalm 37:26). The more devout sort of the Jews to this day 
    distribute the tenth part of their estate to the poor and they have a 
    proverb among them, &quot;Give the tenth, and you will grow rich.&quot; The hypocrite 
    is all for <i>faith</i>, nothing for <i>works</i>; like the laurel which 
    makes fine <i>leaves</i>--but bears no <i>fruit</i>.</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">10. A godly man will suffer persecution</p>
    </b></font>
    <p align="justify">He will be married to Christ, though he settles no other 
    estate on him, than the <i>cross</i>. He suffers out of choice and with a 
    spirit of gallantry (Heb. 11:35). Argerius wrote a letter to his friend, 
    headed: &quot;From the <i>pleasant gardens </i>of the Leonine prison.&quot; The 
    blessed martyrs who put on the whole armor of God, blunted the edge of 
    persecution by their courage. The juniper tree makes the <i>coolest shadow</i>--and 
    the <i>hottest coal</i>. So persecution makes the coal of love hotter--and 
    the shadow of death cooler.</p>
    <p align="justify">Thus a godly man goes round the whole circle of pious 
    duties and obeys God in whatever he commands.</p>
    <i>
    <p align="justify">Objection:</i> But it is impossible for anyone to walk 
    according to the <i>full </i>breadth of God's law, and to follow God <i>
    fully!</p>
    <p align="justify">Answer:</i> There is a twofold obeying of God's law. The 
    first is perfect, when <i>all </i>is done, which the law requires. This we 
    cannot arrive at in this life. Secondly, there is an incomplete obedience 
    which is accepted in Christ. This consists in four things:</p>
    <p align="justify">(1) An approving of all God's commands: &quot;the commandment 
    is holy and just and good . . . I consent unto the law that it is good&quot; 
    (Romans 7:12, 16). There is both assent and consent.</p>
    <p align="justify">(2) A sweet delight in God's commands: &quot;I will delight 
    myself in your commandments, which I have loved&quot; (Psalm 119:47).</p>
    <p align="justify">(3) A cordial desire to walk in all God's commands: &quot;O 
    that my ways were directed to keep your statutes&quot; (Psalm 119:5).</p>
    <p align="justify">(4) A real endeavor to tread in every path of the 
    command: &quot;I turned my feet unto your testimonies&quot; (Psalm 119:59). </p>
    <p align="justify">This, God esteems perfect obedience--and is pleased to 
    take it in good part. Zacharias had his failings; he hesitated through 
    unbelief, for which he was struck dumb. Yet it is said that he &quot;walked in 
    all the commands of the Lord blameless&quot; (Luke 1:6), because he cordially 
    endeavored to obey God in all things. <i>Evangelical obedience</i> is true 
    in its essence, though not perfect in its degree; and where it comes short, 
    Christ puts his merits into the scales--and then there is full weight.</p>

    <p align="justify">&quot;Noah walked with God&quot; (Gen. 6:9). The age in which Noah 
    lived was very corrupt: &quot;the wickedness of man was great in the earth&quot; 
    (v.5). But the iniquity of the times, could not put Noah off his walk: &quot;Noah 
    walked with God.&quot; Noah is called a &quot;preacher of righteousness&quot; (2 Peter 
    2:5):</p>
    <p align="justify">1. <i>Noah preached by <b>doctrine</p>
    </b></i>
    <p align="justify">His preaching (say some of the rabbis) was in this vein: 
    &quot;Turn from your evil ways, so that the waters of the flood will not come 
    upon you and cut off the whole of Adam's race.&quot;</p>
    <p align="justify">2. <i>Noah preached by his <b>life</p>
    </b></i>
    <p align="justify">He preached by his humility, patience, sanctity. &quot;Noah 
    walked with God.&quot; </p>
    <i>
    <p align="justify">Question:</i> What is it, to walk with God?</p>
    <i>
    <p align="justify">Answer:</i> Walking with God imports five things:</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">1. Walking as under God's eye. </b></font>Noah reverenced 
    God. A godly man sets himself as in God's presence, knowing that his judge 
    is looking on: &quot;I have set the Lord always before me&quot; (Psalm 16:8). David's 
    eyes were here.</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">2. The familiarity and intimacy which the soul has with 
    God. </b></font>Friends walk together and console themselves with one 
    another. The godly make known their requests to God--and he makes known his 
    love to them. There is a sweet fellowship between God and his people: &quot;Our 
    fellowship (<i>koinonia</i>) is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus 
    Christ&quot; (1 John 1:3).</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">3. Walking above the earth. </b></font>A godly man is 
    elevated above all sublunary objects. The person who walks with God must 
    ascend very high. A dwarf cannot walk among the stars, nor can a dwarfish, 
    earthly soul walk with God.</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">4. Visible piety</b></font>. Walking is a visible 
    posture. Grace must be conspicuous to the onlookers. He who reveals 
    something of God in his behavior, walks with God. He shines forth in 
    biblical conduct.</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">5. Continued progress in grace.</b></font> It is not only 
    a <i>step</i>--but a <i>walk</i>. There is a going on towards maturity. A 
    godly man does not sit down in the middle of the way--but goes on until he 
    comes to the &quot;end of his faith&quot; (1 Pet. 1:9). Though a good man may be out 
    of the <i>path</i>, he is not out of the way. He may through infirmity step 
    aside (as Peter did)—but he recovers by repentance and goes on in 
    progressive holiness: &quot;The righteous will hold to their ways, and those with 
    clean hands will grow stronger&quot; (Job 17:9).</p>
    <font COLOR="#0000ff"><b>
    <p align="justify">Use 1: </b></font>See from this how improper it is to 
    describe as godly, those who do not walk with God. They want to have Noah's
    <i>crown</i>—but they do not love Noah's <i>walk</i>. Most are found in the<i> 
    devil's black walk!</i> &quot;Many walk, of whom I tell you weeping, that they 
    are the enemies of the cross of Christ&quot; (Phil. 3:18).</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">1. Some will commend walking with God, and say it is the 
    rarest life in the world—but will not set one foot on the way.</b></font> 
    All who commend wine, do not pay the price. Many a father <i>commends </i>
    virtue to his child--but does not set him a <i>pattern</i>.</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">2. Others walk a few steps in the good old ways—but they 
    retreat back again </b></font>(Jer. 6:16). If the ways of God were not good, 
    why did they enter them? If they were good, why did they forsake them? &quot;For 
    it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, 
    than, after they have known it, to turn from the holy commandment&quot; (2 Pet. 
    2:21).</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">3. Others slander walking with God as a melancholy walk</b></font>. 
    God accounts this as blasphemy: &quot;the way of truth shall be evil spoken of&quot; 
    (2 Pet. 2:2). In the Greek it is &quot;it shall be blasphemed.&quot; </p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">4. Others deride walking with God as if it were a way of 
    foolish scrupulosity.</b></font> &quot;What! Do you want to join the &quot;holy 
    tribe&quot;? Do you want to be wiser than others?&quot; There are some people who, if 
    it were in their power, would jeer holiness out of the world. The chair of 
    the scornful, stands at the mouth of hell (Proverbs 19:29).</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">5. Others, instead of walking with God, walk according to 
    the flesh</b></font> (2 Pet. 2:10).</p>
    <p align="justify">(1) They walk by fleshly opinions.</p>
    <p align="justify">(2) They walk according to fleshly lusts.</p>
    <b>
    <p align="justify">(1) They walk by fleshly OPINIONS.</b> There are six of 
    these:</p>
    <p align="justify">(a) That it is best &quot;to do what <i>most </i>do, to steer 
    after the course of the world—and to be in the world's mode.&quot; They think it 
    best--not to get a new <i>heart</i>—but to get into a new <i>fashion</i>.</p>
    <p align="justify">(b) That <i>reason </i>is the highest judge and umpire in 
    matters of piety. &quot;We must believe no further than we can see!&quot; For a man to 
    become a fool that he may be wise, to be saved purely by the righteousness 
    of another, to keep all by losing all—this the natural man will by no means 
    put in his creed.</p>
    <p align="justify">(c) That a little religion will serve the turn. &quot;The <i>
    lifeless form </i>may in be kept up—but zeal is madness!&quot; The world thinks 
    that piety to be best which, like leaf-gold, is spread very thin.</p>
    <p align="justify">(d) That the way which is exposed to affliction is not 
    good. A stick, though it is straight, seems crooked under water. So piety, 
    if it is under affliction, appears crooked to a carnal eye.</p>
    <p align="justify">(e) That all a man's concern should be for the present 
    world. As that profane cardinal said, he &quot;would leave his part in paradise 
    to keep his cardinalship in Paris.&quot;</p>
    <p align="justify">(f) That sinning is better than suffering. It is greater 
    concern to keep the skin whole--than the conscience pure. </p>
    <p align="justify">These are such rules as the crooked serpent has found 
    out—and whoever walks by them, shall neither know God, nor peace.&quot; </p>
    <b>
    <p align="justify">(2) They walk according to fleshly LUSTS.</b> &quot;<i>For 
    those who are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh</i>; but they 
    that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit.&quot; Romans 8:5. &quot;For <i>if 
    you live after the flesh</i>--you shall die: but if you through the Spirit 
    do mortify the deeds of the body--you shall live.&quot; Romans 8:13. They make 
    provision (turn caterers) for the flesh (Romans 13:14). Such a person was 
    the Emperor Heliogabalus. He so indulged the flesh that he never sat except 
    among sweet flowers, mixed with amber and musk. He attired himself in 
    purple, set with precious stones. He did not burn oil in his lamps—but a 
    costly balsam brought from Arabia, very odoriferous. He bathed himself in 
    perfumed water; he put his body to no other use—but to be <i>a strainer for 
    fine food and drink to run through.</i> </p>
    <p align="justify">The ungodly walk according to the flesh. If a drunken or 
    unclean lust calls--they gratify it! They brand as cowards, all who dare not 
    sin at the same rate as they do. These, instead of walking with God, walk 
    contrary to him. Lust is the <i>compass </i>they sail by! Satan is their <i>
    pilot--</i>and hell the <i>port </i>they are bound for.</p>
    <font COLOR="#0000ff"><b>
    <p align="justify">Use 2:</b></font> Let us test whether we have this 
    characteristic of the godly: Do we walk with God? That may be known:</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">1. By the way we walk in.</b></font> It is a private, 
    secluded way, in which only some few holy ones walk. Therefore it is called 
    a &quot;pathway&quot; to distinguish it from the common road: &quot;in the pathway thereof 
    is no death&quot; (Proverbs 12:28). &quot;Enter through the narrow gate. For wide is 
    the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter 
    through it. But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life, 
    and only a few find it.&quot; Matthew 7:13-14. </p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">2. By a walk in the fear of God. </b></font>&quot;Enoch walked 
    with God&quot; (Gen. 5:22). The Chaldean version renders it, &quot;he walked in the 
    fear of the Lord.&quot; The godly are fearful of that which may displease God. 
    &quot;How then can I do this great wickedness--and sin against God!&quot; (Gen. 39:9). 
    This is not a base, servile fear—but:</p>
    <p align="justify">(1) A fear springing from <i>affection </i>(Hos. 3:5). A 
    child fears to offend his father out of the tender affection he has for him. 
    This made holy Anselm say, &quot;If sin were on one side and hell on the other--I 
    would rather leap into hell than willingly offend my God.&quot;</p>
    <p align="justify">(2) A fear joined with <i>faith</i>. &quot;By faith Noah, 
    moved with fear&quot; (Heb. 11:7). Faith and fear go hand in hand. When the soul 
    looks at God's <i>holiness</i>, he fears. When he looks at God's <i>promises</i>, 
    he believes. A godly man <i>trembles</i>—yet <i>trusts</i>. Fear preserves 
    reverence, faith preserves cheerfulness. Fear keeps the soul from lightness, 
    faith keeps it from sadness. By this we may know whether we walk with God, 
    if we walk &quot;in the fear of God.&quot; We are fearful of infringing his laws, and 
    forfeiting his love. It is a brand set upon the ungodly: &quot;There is no fear 
    of God before their eyes&quot; (Romans 3:18). The godly fear--and do not offend 
    (Psalm 4:4). The wicked offend--and do not fear (Jer. 5:23,24). Careless and 
    dissolute walking will soon estrange God from us--and make <i>him </i>weary 
    of our company: &quot;what communion has light with darkness?&quot; (2 Cor. 6:14).</p>
    <font COLOR="#0000ff"><b>
    <p align="justify">Use 3:</b></font> Let me persuade all who wish to be 
    accounted godly, to get into Noah's walk. <b>When the <i>truth </i>of grace 
    is in the heart--the <i>beauty </i>of grace is seen in the walk!</b> 
    &quot;Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old has gone, 
    the new has come!&quot; 2 Corinthians 5:17 </p>
    <p align="justify">1. <i>Walking with God is very pleasing to God</i>. He 
    who walks with God declares to the world, which company he loves most: &quot;His 
    fellowship is with the Father&quot; (1 John 1:3). He counts those the sweetest 
    hours which are spent with God. This is very pleasing and acceptable to God: 
    &quot;Enoch walked with God&quot; (Gen. 5:24). And see how kindly God took this at 
    Enoch's hand: &quot;he had this testimony, that <i>he pleased God&quot; </i>(Heb. 
    11:5).</p>
    <p align="justify">2. <i>Close walking with God will be a good means to 
    entice and allure others to walk with him</i>. The apostle exhorts wives so 
    to walk, that the husbands might be won by their conduct (1 Pet. 3:1). 
    Justin Martyr confessed that he became a Christian by observing the holy and 
    innocent lives of the early saints.</p>
    <p align="justify">3. <i>Close walking with God would put to silence the 
    adversaries of the truth</i> (1 Pet. 2:15). Careless behavior puts a sword 
    into wicked men's hands to wound piety. What a sad thing it is when it is 
    said of professing Christians--that they are as proud, as covetous and as 
    unjust as others! Will this not expose the ways of God to contempt? But holy 
    and close walking would stop the mouths of sinners, so that they should not 
    be able to speak against God's people without giving themselves the lie. 
    Satan came to Christ and &quot;found nothing in him&quot; (John 14:30). What a 
    confounding thing it will be to the wicked when <i>holiness </i>is the only 
    thing they have to fasten on the godly as a crime. &quot;We will never find any 
    basis for charges against this man Daniel unless it has something to do with 
    the law of his God&quot; (Dan. 6:5).</p>
    <p align="justify">4. <i>Walking with God is a pleasant walk</i>. The ways 
    of wisdom are called pleasantness (Proverbs 3:17). Is the <i>light </i>not 
    pleasant? &quot;They shall walk, O Lord, in the <i>light </i>of your countenance&quot; 
    (Psalm 89:15). Walking with God is like walking among beds of spices, which 
    send forth a fragrant perfume. This is what brings peace: &quot;walking in the <i>
    fear </i>of the Lord, and in the <i>comfort </i>of the Holy Spirit&quot; (Acts 
    9:31). While we walk with God, what sweet music the <i>bird of conscience
    </i>makes in our breast! &quot;They shall sing in the ways of the Lord&quot; (Psalm 
    138:5).</p>
    <p align="justify">5. <i>Walking with God is honorable</i>. It is a credit 
    for one of an inferior rank, to walk with a king. What greater dignity can 
    be put upon a mortal man, than to converse with his Maker, and to walk with 
    God every day?</p>
    <p align="justify">6. <i>Walking with God leads to rest:</i> &quot;There remains 
    therefore a rest to the people of God&quot; (Heb. 4:9). Those who walk with their 
    sins shall never have rest: &quot;they rest not day and night&quot; (Rev. 4:8). But 
    those who walk with God shall sit down in the kingdom of God (Luke 13:29); 
    just as a weary traveler, when he comes home, sits down and rests. &quot;To him 
    who overcomes, I will grant to <i>sit </i>with me in my <i>throne</i>&quot; (Rev. 
    3:21). A <i>throne </i>denotes honor, and <i>sitting </i>denotes rest.</p>
    <p align="justify">7. <i>Walking with God is the safest walking.</i> Walking 
    in the ways of <i>sin, </i>is like walking on the banks of a river. The 
    sinner treads on the precipice of the bottomless pit, and if death gives him 
    a jog, he tumbles in. But it is safe going in God's way: &quot;Then shall you 
    walk in your way safely&quot; (Proverbs 3:23). He who walks with a guard walks 
    safely. He who walks with God, shall have God's Spirit to guard him from <i>
    sin</i>, and God's angels to guard him from <i>danger </i>(Psalm 91:11).</p>
    <p align="justify">8. <i>Walking with God will make death sweet</i>. It was 
    Augustus' wish that he might have a euthanasia--a quiet, easy death without 
    much pain. If anything makes our pillow easy at death it will be this, that 
    we have walked with God in our lives. Do we think walking with God can do us 
    any hurt? Did we ever hear any cry out on their deathbed--that they have 
    been too holy, that they have prayed too much, or walked with God too much? 
    No! That which has cut them to the heart has been this--that they have not 
    walked more closely with God! They have wrung their hands, and torn their 
    hair--to think that they have been so bewitched with the pleasures of the 
    world. Close walking with God will make our enemy (death) be at peace with 
    us. When King Ahasuerus could not sleep, he called for the book of records, 
    and read it (Esther 6:1). So when the violence of sickness causes sleep to 
    depart from our eyes, and we can call for conscience (that book of records) 
    and find written in it, &quot;On such a day we humbled our souls by fasting; on 
    such a day our hearts melted in prayer; on such a day we had sweet communion 
    with God&quot;—what a reviving this will be! How we may look death in the face 
    with comfort and say, &quot;Lord, now take us up to you in heaven. Where we have 
    so often been by <i>affection--</i>let us now be by <i>fruition</i>.&quot;</p>
    <p align="justify">9. <i>Walking with God is the best way to know the mind 
    of God</i>. Friends who walk together impart their secrets one to another: 
    &quot;The secret of the Lord is with those who fear him&quot; (Psalm 25:14). Noah 
    walked with God--and the Lord revealed a great secret to him—destroying the 
    old world and saving him in the ark. Abraham walked with God, and God made 
    him one of his privy council (Gen. 24:40): &quot;Shall I hide from Abraham that 
    thing which I do?&quot; (Gen. 18:17). God sometimes sweetly unbosoms himself to 
    the soul in prayer and in the holy supper, as Christ made himself known to 
    the disciples in the breaking of bread (Luke 24:35).</p>
    <p align="justify">10. <i>They who walk with God shall never be wholly left 
    by God</i>. The Lord may withdraw for a time, to make his people cry after 
    him the more—but he will not leave them altogether: &quot;I hid my face from you 
    for a <i>moment</i>; but with <i>everlasting </i>kindness will I have mercy 
    on you&quot; (Isaiah 54:8). God will not cast off any of his old acquaintance; he 
    will not part with one who has kept him company. &quot;Enoch walked with God: and 
    he was not; for God took him&quot; (Gen. 5:24). He took him up to heaven. As the 
    Arabic renders it, &quot;Enoch was lodged in the bosom of divine love.&quot;</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">Question: What may we do, to walk with God?</p>
    </b></font><font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">Answer 1: If you desire to walk with God--get off the old 
    road of sin! </b></font>He who would walk in a pleasant meadow--must turn 
    off the road. The way of sin is full of travelers. There are so many 
    travelers on this road, that hell, though it is of a great circumference, 
    would gladly enlarge itself and make room for them (Isaiah 5:14). <b>This <i>
    way </i>of sin seems pleasant--but the <i>end </i>is damnable. </b>&quot;I have&quot;, 
    says the harlot, &quot;perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes and cinnamon&quot; (Proverbs 
    7:17). See how with <i>one sweet</i> (the cinnamon) there were <i>two 
    bitters </i>(myrrh and aloes). For that little sweet in sin at present there 
    will be a far greater proportion of bitterness afterwards. Therefore get out 
    of these briars. You cannot walk with God and sin: &quot;what fellowship has 
    righteousness with unrighteousness?&quot; (2 Cor. 6:14).</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">Answer 2: If you wish to walk with God--get acquainted 
    with him.</b></font> &quot;Acquaint now yourself with him&quot; (Job 22:21). Know God 
    in his attributes and promises. Strangers do not walk together.</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">Answer 3: If you desire to walk with God--get all 
    differences removed. </b></font>&quot;Can two walk together, except they are 
    agreed?&quot; (Amos 3:3). This agreement and reconciliation is made by faith: 
    &quot;God presented him as a sacrifice of atonement, through faith in his blood&quot; 
    (Romans 3:25). When once we are friends, then we shall be called up to the 
    top of the mount like Moses, and have this dignity conferred on us--to be 
    the favorites of heaven and to forever walk with God.</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">Answer 4: If you desire to walk with God--get a liking 
    for the ways of God.</b></font> They are <i>adorned </i>with beauty 
    (Proverbs 4:18); </p>
    <p align="justify">they are <i>sweetened </i>with pleasure (Proverbs 3:17);
    </p>
    <p align="justify">they are <i>fenced </i>with truth (Rev. 15:3); </p>
    <p align="justify">they are <i>accompanied </i>with life (Acts 2:28); </p>
    <p align="justify">they are lengthened with eternity (Hab. 3:6).</p>
    <p align="justify">Be enamored with the way of piety--and you will soon walk 
    in it.</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">Answer 5: If you desire to walk with God--take hold of 
    his arm. </b></font>Those who walk in their own strength will soon grow 
    weary and tire. &quot;I will go in the strength of the Lord God&quot; (Psalm 71:16). 
    We cannot walk with God, without God. Let us press him with his promise: &quot;I 
    will cause you to walk in my statutes&quot; (Ezek. 36:27). If God takes us by the 
    hand, then we shall &quot;walk, and not faint&quot; (Isaiah 40:31).</p>

    <p align="justify">24. A godly man strives to be an instrument for making 
    others godly</p>
    </b></font></h2>
    <p align="justify">He is not content to go to heaven alone, but wants to 
    take others there. <i>Spiders </i>work only for themselves—but <i>bees </i>
    work for others. A godly man is both a diamond and a magnet—a diamond for 
    the sparkling luster of grace, and a magnet for his attractiveness. He is 
    always drawing others to embrace piety. Living things have a propagating 
    virtue. Where piety lives in the heart, there will be an endeavor to 
    propagate the life of grace in those we converse with: &quot;My son, Onesimus, 
    whom I have begotten in my bonds&quot; (Philem. 10). Though God is the <i>
    fountain of grace</i>—yet the saints are the <i>pipes </i>which transmit the 
    living streams to others. </p>
    <font COLOR="#0000ff"><b>
    <p align="justify">This great effort for the conversion of souls proceeds:</p>
    </b></font><font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">1. From the nature of godliness</p>
    </b></font>
    <p align="justify">Grace is like fire--which assimilates and turns 
    everything into its own nature. Where there is the fire of grace in the 
    heart, it will endeavor to inflame others. Grace is a holy leaven, which 
    will be seasoning and leavening others with divine principles. Paul would 
    gladly have converted Agrippa—how he courted him with rhetoric! &quot;King 
    Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know you do&quot; (Acts 26:27). His zeal 
    and eloquence had almost captivated the king (v. 28). Then Agrippa said to 
    Paul, &quot;Do you think that in such a short time you can <i>persuade </i>me to 
    be a Christian?&quot;</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">2. From a spirit of compassion</p>
    </b></font>
    <p align="justify">Grace makes the heart tender. A godly man pities those 
    who are in the gall of bitterness. He sees what a deadly cup is brewing for 
    the wicked! They must, without repentance, be bound over to God's wrath! The 
    fire which rained on Sodom was but a <i>painted fire</i> in comparison with 
    hell fire. This is a fire with a vengeance: &quot;Suffering the vengeance of 
    eternal fire&quot; (Jude 7). Now when a godly man sees Satan's captives ready to 
    be damned, he strives to convert them from the error of their way: &quot;Knowing 
    the terror of the Lord, we persuade men&quot; (2 Cor. 5:11).</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">3. From a holy zeal he has for Christ's glory</p>

    greatest effort to bring souls to Christ.</p>
    <p align="justify">It is a glory to Christ, when multitudes are born to him. 
    Every star adds a luster to the sky; every convert is a member added to 
    Christ's body, and a jewel adorning his crown. Though Christ's glory cannot 
    be increased, as he is God—yet as he is Mediator, it may. The more that are 
    saved, the more Christ is exalted. Why else should the angels rejoice at the 
    conversion of a sinner—but because Christ's glory now shines the more? (Luke 
    15:10)</p>
    <font COLOR="#0000ff"><b>
    <p align="justify">Use 1:</b></font> This excludes those who are <i>
    spiritual eunuchs </i>from the number of the godly. They do not strive to 
    promote the salvation of others. &quot;The one through whom no one else is 
    born--is himself born unworthily.&quot;</p>
    <p align="justify">1. <i>If men loved Christ, they would try to draw as many 
    as they could to him</i>. He who loves his captain will persuade others to 
    come under his banner. This unmasks the hypocrite. Though a hypocrite may 
    make a show of grace himself—yet he never bothers to procure grace in 
    others. He is without compassion. I may allude to the verse: &quot;Let the dying 
    die, and the perishing perish. Let those who are left eat one another's 
    flesh&quot; (Zech. 11:9). Let souls go to the devil, he cares not.</p>
    <p align="justify">2. <i>How far from being godly are those who instead of 
    striving for grace in others, work to destroy all hopeful beginnings of 
    grace in them!</i> Instead of drawing them <i>to </i>Christ, they draw them
    <i>from </i>Christ. Their work is to poison and harm souls. This harming of 
    souls occurs in three ways:</p>
    <p align="justify">(1) <i>By bad <b>edicts</b></i>. So Jeroboam made Israel 
    sin (1 Kings 16:26). He forced them to idolatry.</p>
    <p align="justify">(2) <i>By bad <b>examples</b></i>. Examples speak louder 
    than precepts—but principally the examples of great men are influential. Men 
    placed on high, are like the &quot;pillar of cloud.&quot; When that went, Israel went. 
    If great men live sinfully, others will follow them.</p>
    <p align="justify">(3) <i>By bad <b>company</b></i>. The breath of sinners 
    is infectious. They are like the dragon which &quot;cast a flood out of his 
    mouth&quot; (Rev. 12:15). They cast a flood of oaths out of their mouths. Wicked 
    tongues are set on fire by hell (Jas. 3:6). The sinner brings match and 
    gunpowder--and the devil brings the fire! The wicked are forever setting 
    snares and temptations before others, as the prophet speaks in another 
    sense: &quot;I set pots full of wine, and cups, and I said unto them--Drink&quot; (Jer 
    . 35:5). So the wicked set pots of wine before others and make them drink, 
    until reason is stupefied and lust inflamed. These who make men proselytes 
    to the devil--are prodigiously wicked. How sad will be the doom of those 
    who, besides their own sins, have the blood of others to answer for!</p>
    <p align="justify">3. <i>If it is the sign of a godly man to promote grace 
    in others--then how much more ought he to promote it in his near relations</i>. 
    A godly man will be careful that his children should know God. He would be 
    very sad if any of his family should burn in hell. He labors to see Christ 
    formed in those who are <i>himself in another edition</i>. Augustine says 
    that his mother Monica travailed with greater care and pain for his 
    spiritual than for his natural birth.</p>
    <p align="justify">The time of childhood is the fittest time to be sowing <i>
    seeds of piety </i>in our children. &quot;Who is it he is trying to teach? To 
    whom is he explaining his message? To children weaned from their milk, to 
    those just taken from the breast&quot; (Isaiah 28:9). The <i>wax</i>, while it is 
    soft and tender, will take any impression. Children, while they are young, 
    will <i>fear </i>a reproof; when they are old, they will <i>hate </i>it.</p>
    <p align="justify">(1) It is pleasing to God that our children should know 
    him early in life. When you come into a garden, you love to pluck the young 
    bud and smell it. God loves <i>a saint in the bud</i>. Of all the trees 
    which the Lord could have chosen in a prophetic vision (Jer. 1:11), he chose 
    the almond tree, which is one of the first of the trees to blossom. Such an 
    almond tree is an early convert.</p>
    <p align="justify">(2) By endeavoring to bring up our children in the fear 
    of the Lord, we shall provide for God's glory when we are dead. A godly man 
    should not only honor God while he lives—but do something that may promote 
    God's glory when he is dead. If our children are seasoned with gracious 
    principles, they will stand up in our place when we have gone, and will 
    glorify God in their generation. A good piece of ground bears not only a <i>
    fore-crop </i>but an <i>after-crop</i>. He who is godly does not only bear 
    God a good crop of obedience himself while he lives—but by training his 
    child in the principles of piety, he bears God an after-crop when he is 
    dead.</p>
    <font COLOR="#0000ff"><b>
    <p align="justify">Use 2:</b></font> Let all who have God's name placed on 
    them, do what in them lies to advance piety in others. A knife touched with 
    a magnet, will attract the needle. He whose heart is divinely touched with 
    the magnet of God's Spirit, will endeavor to attract those who are near him 
    to Christ. The heathen could say, &quot;We are not born for ourselves only.&quot; The 
    more <i>excellent </i>anything is, the more <i>diffusive </i>it is. In the 
    body every member is diffusive: the eye conveys light; the head, spirits; 
    the heart, blood. A Christian must not move altogether within his own 
    circle—but seek the welfare of others. To be diffusively good makes us 
    resemble God, whose sacred influence is universal.</p>
    <p align="justify">And surely it will be no grief of heart, when conscience 
    can witness for us that we have brought glory to God in this matter by 
    working to fill heaven.</p>
    <p align="justify">Not that this is in any way <i>meritorious</i>, or has 
    any <i>causal </i>influence on our salvation. Christ's blood is the sole 
    cause—but our promoting God's glory in the conversion of others--is a signal 
    evidence of our salvation. As the rainbow is not a cause why God will not 
    drown the world—but is a sign that he will not drown it; or as Rahab's 
    scarlet thread hung out of the window (Joshua 2:18) was not a cause why she 
    was exempted from destruction—but was a sign of her being exempted; just so, 
    our building up others in the faith is not a cause why we are saved--but it 
    is a symbol of our piety and a presage of our eternal felicity!</p>
    <p align="justify">And thus I have shown the marks and characteristics of a 
    godly man. If a person thus described is reputed a fanatic, then Abraham and 
    Moses and David and Paul were fanatics, which I think none but atheists will 
    dare to affirm!</p>
	
	<h1><font COLOR="#ff0000" size="4"><b>
    <p align="center"><br>
    Two Conclusions</p>
    </b></font></h1>
    <p align="justify">Concerning the characteristic signs aforementioned, I 
    shall lay down two conclusions:</p>
    <font COLOR="#0000ff"><b>
    <p align="justify">1. These characteristics are a Christian's box of 
    evidences</p>
    </b></font>
    <p align="justify">For as an impenitent sinner has the signs of reprobation 
    on him, by which, as by so many spots and tokens, he may know he shall die, 
    so whoever can show these happy signs of a godly man, may see the evidences 
    of salvation in his soul, and may know he has &quot;passed from death unto life&quot; 
    (John 5:24). He is as sure to go to heaven as if he were in heaven already. 
    Such a person is undoubtedly a member of Christ—and if he should perish, 
    then a member of Christ might perish.</p>
    <p align="justify">These blessed characteristics may comfort a Christian 
    under all worldly dejection and diabolical suggestions. Satan tempts a child 
    of God with this—that he is a hypocrite and has no title to the land of 
    promise. A Christian may pull out these evidences and challenge the devil to 
    prove that any wicked man or hypocrite ever had such a good certificate to 
    show for heaven. Satan may sooner prove himself a liar, than the saint a 
    hypocrite.</p>
    <font COLOR="#0000ff"><b>
    <p align="justify">2. Whoever has one of these characteristics in truth, has 
    everything in embryo</p>
    </b></font>
    <p align="justify">Whoever has one link of a chain has the whole chain.</p>
    <i>
    <p align="justify">Objection:</i> But may a child of God say, &quot;Either I do 
    not have all these characteristics or else they are so faintly stamped in me 
    that I cannot discern them&quot;?</p>
    <i>
    <p align="justify">Answer:</i> To satisfy this scruple you must diligently 
    observe the distinctions which the Scripture makes between Christians. It 
    puts them into several classes and orders. Some are <i>little children </i>
    who have only recently begun breast-feeding on the gospel; others are<i> 
    young men </i>who have grown up to more maturity of grace; others are <i>
    fathers </i>who are ready to take their degree of glory (1 John 2:12-14). 
    Now, you who are only in the first rank or class may still have the <i>
    vitals </i>of godliness, as well as those who have arrived at a higher 
    stature in Christ. </p>
    <p align="justify">The Scripture speaks of the <i>cedar </i>and the <i>
    bruised reed</i>; the latter of which is as true a plant of the heavenly 
    paradise, as the other. So the weakest ought not to be discouraged. Not all 
    have these characteristics of godliness written in capital letters. If they 
    are only faintly stamped on their souls, God can read the work of his Spirit 
    there. Though the seal is only faintly set on the wax, it ratifies the will 
    and gives a real conveyance of an estate. If there is found just some good 
    thing towards the Lord (as it was said of Abijah), God will accept it (1 
    Kings 14:13).<br>
&nbsp;</p>
    <h1><font COLOR="#ff0000" size="4"><b>
    <p align="center">An Exhortation to Godliness</p>
    </b></font></h1>
    <p align="justify">Those who are still in their natural condition, who have 
    never yet relished any sweetness in the things of God—let me beseech them, 
    for the love of Christ, to strive to get these characteristics of the godly 
    engraved on their hearts. Though godliness is the object of the world's 
    scorn and hatred (as in Tertullian's days, the name of a Christian was a 
    crime)—yet do not be ashamed to espouse godliness. Know that <i>persecuted 
    godliness</i> is better than <i>prosperous wickedness!</i> What will all the 
    world avail a man without godliness? To be <i>learned </i>and ungodly<i>—</i>is 
    like a devil transformed into an angel of light; to be <i>beautiful </i>and 
    ungodly—is like a lovely picture hung in an infected room; to be <i>
    honorable </i>in the world and ungodly—is like an ape in purple, or like 
    that image which had a head of gold on feet of clay (Dan. 2:32,33). It is 
    godliness which ennobles and consecrates the heart, making God and angels 
    fall in love with it.</p>
    <p align="justify">Strive for the reality of godliness. Do not rest in the 
    common workings of God's Spirit. Do not think that it is enough to be 
    intelligent and discursive. A man may discourse of piety to the admiration 
    of others—yet not feel the sweetness of those things in his own soul. The 
    lute gives a melodious sound to others—but does not at all feel the sound 
    itself. Judas could make an elegant discourse about Christ—but did not feel 
    virtue from him.</p>
    <p align="justify">Do not rest in having your affections a little stirred. A 
    hypocrite may have affections of <i>sorrow </i>like Ahab, or affections of
    <i>desire </i>like Balaam. These are slight and flashy, and do not amount to 
    real godliness. Oh, strive to be like the king's daughter, &quot;all glorious 
    within!&quot; (Psalm 45:13)</p>
    <p align="justify">In order that I may persuade men to become godly, I shall 
    lay down some forcible motives and arguments, and may the Lord make them 
    like nails fastened by his Spirit.</p>
    <h2><b><font COLOR="#0000ff">
    <p align="justify">A. Let men seriously weigh their misery while they remain 
    in a state of ungodliness</p>
    </font></b></h2>
    <p align="justify">It may make them run out of this Sodom.
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>The misery of ungodly men appears in nine 
    particulars:</p>
    </b></font><font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">1. They are in a state of spiritual death</p>
    </b></font><i>
    <p align="justify">&quot;Dead in trespasses&quot;</i> (Eph. 2:1). Dead they must 
    surely be, who are cut off from Christ, the principle of life. For as the 
    body without the soul is dead, so is the soul without Christ. This spiritual 
    death is visible in the effect. It bereaves men of their senses. Sinners 
    have no sense of God in them: &quot;Having lost all sensitivity&quot; (Eph. 4:19). All 
    their moral endowments, are only flowers strewn on a dead corpse, and what 
    is hell but a sepulcher to bury the spiritually dead in?</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">2. Their offerings are polluted</p>
    </b></font>
    <p align="justify">Not only the <i>ploughing </i>of the wicked is sin, but 
    the <i>praying </i>of the wicked is sin! &quot;The sacrifice of the wicked is an 
    abomination to the Lord&quot; (Proverbs 15:8; 21:4). If the water is foul in the
    <i>well</i>—it cannot be clean in the <i>bucket</i>. If the <i>heart </i>is 
    full of sin—the <i>duties </i>cannot be pure. What straits every ungodly 
    person is in, if he does not come to the ordinance. If he does not come—he
    <i>despises </i>it; if he does come—he <i>defiles </i>it.</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">3. Those who live and die ungodly, have no right to the 
    covenant of grace</p>
    </b></font>
    <p align="justify">&quot;At that time you were without Christ, strangers from the 
    covenants of promise&quot; (Eph. 2:12). And to be outside covenant, is to be like 
    anyone in the old world outside the ark. The covenant is the gospel charter, 
    which is enriched with many glorious privileges. But who may plead the 
    benefit of this covenant? Surely only those whose hearts are inlaid with 
    grace. Read the charter: &quot;A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit 
    will I put within you . . . I will be your God&quot; (Ezek. 36:26,28). A person 
    dying in his ungodliness has no more to do with the new covenant, than a 
    ploughman has to do with the privileges of a city corporation.</p>
    <p align="justify">God's writing always comes before his seal. &quot;You are 
    declared to be the epistle of Christ, written not with ink—but with the 
    Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone—but in fleshy tables of the 
    heart&quot; (2 Cor. 3:3). Here is a golden epistle: the writing is the work of 
    faith; the tablet it is written on, is the heart; the finger that writes it 
    is the Spirit. Now, after the Spirit's writing, comes the Spirit's sealing: 
    &quot;after you believed, you were sealed with the Holy Spirit&quot; (Eph. 1:13). That 
    is, you were sealed with an assurance of glory. What have ungodly men—those 
    who have no writing—to do with the seal of the covenant?</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">4. The ungodly are spiritual fools</p>
    </b></font>
    <p align="justify">If a parent had a child who was very beautiful—but a 
    fool, he would take little joy in him. The Scripture has dressed the sinner 
    in a fool's coat and let me tell you—better be a fool void of reason, than a 
    fool void of grace. This is the devil's fool, &quot;Fools make a mock at sin&quot; 
    (Proverbs 14:9). Is not that man a fool who refuses a rich share? God offers 
    Christ and salvation—but the sinner refuses this share: &quot;Israel would not 
    submit to me&quot; (Psalm 81:11). Is not that man a fool who prefers a shiny 
    penny before an inheritance? Is not that man a fool who tends his <i>mortal
    </i>part and neglects his <i>angelic </i>part, as if a man should paint the 
    wall of his house and let the timber rot? Is not that man a fool who will 
    feed the devil with his soul—like that emperor who fed his lion with 
    pheasant? Is not that man a fool who lays a snare for himself (Proverbs 
    1:18); who consults his own shame (Hab. 2:10); who loves death (Proverbs 
    8:36)?</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">5. The ungodly are vile people</p>
    </b></font>
    <p align="justify">&quot;I will make your grave; for you are vile&quot; (Nah. 1:14). 
    Sin makes men base; it blots their name; it taints their blood. &quot;They are 
    all together become filthy&quot; (Psalm 14:3). In the Hebrew it is &quot;they have 
    become stinking.&quot; If you call wicked men ever so bad, you cannot call them 
    worse than their name deserves: they are swine (Matt. 7:6); vipers (Matt. 
    3:7); devils (John 6:70). The wicked are dross and refuse (Psalm 119:119), 
    and heaven is too pure to have any dross mingled with it.</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">6. Their temporal mercies are continued in judgment </p>
    </b></font>
    <p align="justify">The wicked may have health and estate, yes, more than 
    heart can wish (Psalm 73:7)—but &quot;their table is a snare&quot; (Psalm 69:22). 
    Sinners have their mercies with God's <i>permission</i>, but not with his <i>
    love</i>. The people of Israel would have been better without their quail, 
    than to have had such sour sauce. The ungodly are usurpers; they lack a 
    spiritual title to what they possess. Their good things are like cloth 
    picked up at the draper's which is not paid for. Death will bring a sad 
    reckoning at last.</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">7. Their temporal judgments are not removed in mercy </p>
    </b></font>
    <p align="justify">Pharaoh had ten arrows shot at him (ten plagues) and all 
    those plagues were removed; but as his heart remained hard, those plagues 
    were not removed in mercy. It was not a preservation—but a reservation. God 
    reserved him as a signal monument of his justice, when he was drowned in the 
    depths of the sea. God may reprieve men's <i>lives</i>, when he does not 
    remit their <i>sins</i>. The wicked may have <i>sparing </i>mercy, but not
    <i>saving </i>mercy.</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">8. The ungodly, while they live, are exposed to the wrath 
    of God</p>
    </b></font>
    <p align="justify">&quot;He who believes not, the wrath of God abides on him&quot; 
    (John 3:36). Whoever lacks grace is like someone who lacks a pardon; every 
    hour he is in fear of execution. How can a wicked man rejoice? Over his head 
    hangs the sword of God's justice; and under him hell-fire burns.</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">9. The ungodly at death, must undergo God's fury and 
    indignation</p>
    </b></font>
    <p align="justify">&quot;The wicked shall be turned into hell&quot; (Psalm 9:17). I 
    have read of a lodestone in Ethiopia which has two corners. With one it 
    attracts iron and with the other it repels it. So God has two hands: one of 
    mercy and one of justice. With the one, he will draw the godly to heaven; 
    with the other, he will thrust the sinner to hell. </p>
    <p align="justify">And oh, how dreadful is that place! It is called a fiery 
    lake (Rev. 20:15). That is, a <i>lake </i>to denote the many torments in 
    hell; and a fiery lake to show the fierceness of the punishment. Strabo in 
    his &quot;Geography&quot; mentions a lake in Galilee of such a pestiferous nature that 
    it scalds off the skin of whatever is thrown into it. But alas, that lake is 
    cool, compared with this fiery lake into which the damned are thrown. To 
    demonstrate that this fire is terrible, there are two most pernicious 
    qualities in it:</p>
    <p align="justify">(1) It is sulphurous; it is mixed with brimstone (Rev. 
    21:8), which is unsavory and suffocating.</p>
    <p align="justify">(2) It is inextinguishable: the wicked shall be choked in 
    the flames, though not consumed: &quot;And the devil was cast into the lake of 
    fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be 
    tormented day and night forever and ever&quot; (Rev. 20:10). See the deplorable 
    condition of all ungodly people! In the eternal world, they shall have a 
    life which always dies, and a death which always lives. May this not 
    frighten men off their sins and make them become godly, unless they are 
    resolved to feel how hot hell-fire is?</p>
    <h2><font COLOR="#0000ff"><b>
    <p align="justify">B. What rare people the godly are</p>
    </b></font></h2>
    <p align="justify">&quot;The righteous is more excellent than his neighbor&quot; 
    (Proverbs 12:26). Like the flower of the sun, like the wine of Lebanon, like 
    the sparkling on Aaron's breastplate, such is the oriental splendor of a 
    person embellished with godliness. The excellence of the godly appears in 
    seven particulars:</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">1. The godly are PRECIOUS</p>
    </b></font>
    <p align="justify">Therefore they are set apart for God: &quot;know that the Lord 
    has set apart him who is godly for himself&quot; (Psalm 4:3). We set apart things 
    that are precious. The godly are set apart as God's peculiar treasure (Psalm 
    135:4); as his garden of delight (Song 4:12); as his royal diadem (Isaiah 
    62:3). The godly are the excellent of the earth (Psalm 16:3), comparable to 
    fine gold (Lam. 4:2); doubly refined (Zech. 13:9); they are the glory of 
    creation (Isaiah 46:13.) Origen compares the saints to sapphires and 
    crystal. God calls them his jewels (Mal. 3:17). They are jewels:</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">(1) For their value.</b></font> Diamonds (says Pliny) 
    were not known for a long time except among princes, and were hung on their 
    diadems. God so values his people that he will give kingdoms for their 
    ransom (Isaiah 43:3); He put his best Jewel (Christ) in pawn for them (John 
    3:16).</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">(2) For their luster.</b></font> If one <i>pearl of grace
    </i>shines so brightly that it delights Christ's heart—&quot;You have ravished my 
    heart with one of your eyes&quot; (Song 4:9), that is, one of your graces—then 
    how illustrious are all the graces together in a constellation!</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">2. The godly are HONORABLE</p>
    </b></font>
    <p align="justify">&quot;You have been honorable&quot; (Isaiah 43:4). The godly are &quot;a 
    crown of glory in the hand of the Lord&quot; (Isaiah 62:3). They are &quot;plants of 
    renown&quot; (Ezek. 16:14). They are not only vessels of mercy but vessels of 
    honor (2 Tim. 2:21). Aristotle calls honor the chief good thing. The godly 
    are near akin to the blessed Trinity: they have the tutelage and 
    guardianship of angels; they have &quot;God's name written upon them&quot; (Rev. 3:12) 
    and &quot;the Holy Spirit dwelling in them&quot; (2 Tim. 1:14).</p>
    <p align="justify">The godly are a sacred priesthood. The priesthood under 
    the law was honorable. The king's daughter was wife to Jehoiada the priest 
    (2 Chron. 22:11). It was a custom among the Egyptians to have their kings 
    chosen from their priests. The saints are a divine priesthood to offer up 
    spiritual sacrifices (1 Pet 2:9). They are co-heirs with Christ (Romans 
    8:17). They are kings (Rev. 1:6). Novarinus tells of an ancient king who 
    invited a company of poor Christians and made them a great feast. On being 
    asked why he showed so much respect to people of such poor birth and 
    extraction, he told them, &quot;These I must honor as the children of the most 
    high God. They will be kings and princes with me in the eternal world.&quot; </p>
    <p align="justify">The godly are in some sense higher than the angels. The 
    angels are Christ's <i>friends</i>; these are his <i>spouse</i>. The angels 
    are called morning stars (Job 38:7)—but the saints are clothed with the Sun 
    of righteousness (Rev. 12:1). All men, says Chrysostom, are ambitious for 
    honor. See, then, the honor of the godly! &quot;Wisdom is supreme; therefore get 
    wisdom. Though it cost all you have, get understanding. Esteem her, and she 
    will exalt you; embrace her, and she will honor you.&quot; (Proverbs 4:7,8). The 
    trophies of the saints' renown, will be erected in the eternal world.</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">3. The godly are LOVED by God</p>
    </b></font>
    <p align="justify">&quot;The excellency of Jacob, whom he loved&quot; (Psalm 47:4). A 
    holy heart is the garden where God plants the flower of his love. God's love 
    to his people is an ancient love, it dates from eternity (Eph. 1:4). He 
    loves them with a choice, distinguishing love; they are the &quot;dearly beloved 
    of his soul&quot; (Jer. 12:7). The men of the world have bounty dropping from 
    God's <i>fingers</i>—but the godly have love dropping from God's <i>heart</i>. 
    He gives to one, a golden <i>cup</i>—to the other, a golden <i>kiss</i>. He 
    loves the godly as he loves Christ (John 17:26). It is the same love in 
    kind, though not in degree. Here the saints merely <i>sip </i>God's love; in 
    heaven they shall drink of <i>rivers </i>of pleasure (Psalm 36:8). The love 
    of God to His people is permanent. Death may take their life away from 
    them—but not God's love: &quot;I have loved you with an everlasting love; I have 
    drawn you with loving-kindness&quot; (Jer. 31:3).</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">4. The godly are PRUDENT people</p>
    </b></font>
    <p align="justify">They have good insight and foresight:</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">(1) They have good INSIGHT.</b></font> &quot;He who is 
    spiritual judges all things&quot; (1 Cor. 2:15). The godly have insight into 
    people and things. They have insight into <b>people</b>, because they have 
    the anointing of God, and by a spirit of discerning they can see some 
    differences between the precious and the vile (Jer. 15:19). God's people are 
    not <i>censorious</i>—but they are <i>judicious</i>. They can see a foul 
    heart—through a naked breast and a painted face. They can see a revengeful 
    spirit—through a bitter tongue. They can guess at the <i>tree</i>—by the <i>
    fruit </i>(Matt. 12:33). They can see the plague tokens of sin appearing in 
    the wicked, which makes them leave the tents of those sinners (Numb. 16:26).</p>
    <p align="justify">The godly have insight into <b>things </b>mysterious. 
    They can see much of the mystery of their own <b>hearts</b>. Take the 
    greatest politician who understands the mysteries of state—he still does not 
    understand the mystery of his own heart. You will sometimes hear him swear 
    that his heart is good—but a child of God sees much heart corruption (1 
    Kings 8:38). Though some flowers of grace grow there, he still sees how fast 
    the weeds of sin grow, and is therefore continually weeding his heart by 
    repentance and mortification.</p>
    <p align="justify">The godly can discern the mystery of the <b>times</b>: 
    &quot;The children of Issachar were men who had understanding of the times&quot; (1 
    Chron. 12:32). The godly can see when an age runs to seed—when God's name is 
    dishonored, his messengers despised, his gospel eclipsed. The people of God 
    strive to keep their garments pure (Rev. 16:15). Their care is that the 
    times may not be the worse because of them; nor they the worse because of 
    the times.</p>
    <p align="justify">The godly understand the mystery of living by faith: &quot;The 
    just shall live by faith&quot; (Heb. 10:38). They can trust God's <i>heart</i>—where 
    they cannot trace his <i>hand</i>. They can get comfort out of a promise, as 
    Moses got water out of the rock (Exod. 17:6). &quot;Even though the fig trees 
    have no blossoms, and there are no grapes on the vine; even though the olive 
    crop fails, and the fields lie empty and barren; even though the flocks die 
    in the fields, and the cattle barns are empty, yet I will rejoice in the 
    Lord! I will be joyful in the God of my salvation&quot; (Hab. 3:17,18).</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">(2) They have good FORESIGHT.</b></font> They foresee the 
    evil of a temptation: &quot;we are not ignorant of his devices&quot; (2 Cor. 2:11). 
    The wicked swallow temptations like pills, and when it is too late, feel 
    these pills afflict their conscience. But the godly foresee a temptation, 
    and will not come near. They see a snake under the beautiful flowers! They 
    know that <i>Satan's kindness—</i>is craftiness!</p>
    <p align="justify">The godly foresee temporal dangers: &quot;A prudent man 
    foresees the evil, and hides himself&quot; (Proverbs 22:3). The people of God see 
    when the cloud of wrath is ready to drop on a nation, and they get into 
    their <i>rooms </i>(Isaiah 26:20)—the attributes and promises of God; and 
    into the clefts of the rocks—the bleeding wounds of Christ—and hide 
    themselves. Well therefore, may they be baptized with the name of wise 
    virgins.</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">5. The godly are the bulwark of a nation</p>
    </b></font>
    <p align="justify">The godly are the pillars to keep a city and nation from 
    falling; they stave off judgment from a land. It was said of old, that so 
    long as Hector lived, Troy could not be demolished. God could do nothing to 
    Sodom—until Lot had gone out of it (Gen. 19:22). Golden Christians are 
    bronze walls. The Lord would soon execute judgment in the world—were it not 
    for the sake of a few pious people. Would God preserve the world only for 
    drunkards and swearers? He would soon sink the ship—but for the fact that 
    some of his elect are in it. Yet such is the indiscretion of men that they 
    injure the saints and count as burdens, those who are the chief blessings 
    (Isaiah 19:24).</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">6. The godly are of a BRAVE, heroic spirit</p>
    </b></font>
    <p align="justify">&quot;My servant Caleb, because he had another spirit&quot; (Numb. 
    14:24). An excellent spirit was found in Daniel (Dan. 5:12). The godly hate 
    that which is base and sordid. They will not enrich their purses by 
    enslaving their consciences. They are noble and courageous in God's cause: 
    &quot;the righteous are bold as a lion&quot; (Proverbs 28.1). The saints live in 
    accordance with their high birth: they yearn for God's love; they aspire to 
    glory; <i>they set their feet where worldly men set their heart; </i>they 
    display the banner of the gospel, lifting up Christ's name and interest in 
    the world.</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">7. The godly are HAPPY people</p>
    </b></font>
    <p align="justify">King Balak sent to curse the people of God—but the Lord 
    would not allow it. &quot;God said unto Balaam, You shall not curse the people: 
    for they are blessed&quot; (Numb. 22:12). And Moses afterwards records it as a 
    memorable thing that God turned the king's intended curse into a blessing: 
    &quot;the Lord your God turned the curse into a blessing unto you&quot; (Deut. 23:5). 
    Those who are always on the strongest side must of necessity be happy: &quot;The 
    Lord is on my side&quot; (Psalm 118:6). They are happy—who have all conditions 
    sanctified to them (Romans 8:28), who are crowned with <i>peace </i>while 
    they live (Psalm 119:165) and with <i>glory </i>when they die (Psalm 73:24). 
    And may this not tempt everyone to become godly? &quot;Happy are you, O Israel: a 
    people saved by the Lord!&quot; (Deut. 33:29).</p>
    <h2><font COLOR="#0000ff"><b>
    <p align="justify">C. To strive for godliness is most rational</p>
    </b></font></h2>
    <p align="justify">1. <i>It is the highest act of reason, to become a 
    Christian</p>
    </i>
    <p align="justify">If, while he remains in nature's soil, he is poisoned 
    with sin—no more actually fit for communion with God than a toad is fit to 
    be made an angel—then it is very consonant to reason that he should strive 
    for a change.</p>
    <p align="justify">2. <i>It is rational because this change is for the 
    better</p>
    </i>
    <p align="justify">&quot;Now are you light in the Lord&quot; (Eph. 5:8). Will not 
    anyone be willing to exchange a dark prison—for a king's palace? Will he not 
    exchange his brass—for gold? You who become godly change for the better: you 
    change your pride—for humility; you change your uncleanness—for holiness. 
    You change a lust that will damn you—for a Christ who will save you. If men 
    were not besotted, if their <i>fall </i>had not knocked their brains 
    out—they would see that it is the most rational thing in the world to become 
    godly.</p>
    <h2><font COLOR="#0000ff"><b>
    <p align="justify">D. The excellence of godliness</p>
    </b></font></h2>
    <p align="justify">The excellence of godliness appears in several ways:</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">1. Godliness is our spiritual beauty</p>
    </b></font>
    <p align="justify">&quot;The beauties of holiness&quot; (Psalm 110:3). Godliness is to 
    the soul, what the light is to the world—to illustrate and adorn it. It is 
    not <i>greatness </i>which approves us in God's eye—but <i>goodness</i>. 
    What is the beauty of the angels—but their sanctity? Godliness is the 
    intricate embroidery and workmanship of the Holy Spirit. A soul furnished 
    with godliness is filled with beauty, it is enameled with purity. This is 
    the clothing of <i>wrought gold </i>which makes the King of heaven fall in 
    love with us. Were there no excellence in holiness, the hypocrite would 
    never try to paint it. Godliness sheds a glory and luster on the saints. 
    What are the <i>graces</i>—but the golden feathers in which Christ's dove 
    shines! (Psalm 68:13)</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">2. Godliness is our defense</p>
    </b></font>
    <p align="justify">Grace is called &quot;the armor of light&quot; (Romans 13:12). It 
    is <i>light </i>for beauty, and <i>armor </i>for defense. A Christian has 
    armor of God's making, which cannot be shot through. He has the shield of 
    faith, the helmet of hope, the breastplate of righteousness. This armor 
    defends against the assaults of temptation, and the terror of hell.</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">3. Godliness breeds solid peace</p>
    </b></font>
    <p align="justify">&quot;Great peace have those who love your law&quot; (Psalm 
    119:165). Godliness composes the heart, making it quiet and calm like the 
    upper region, where there are no winds and tempests. How can that heart be 
    unquiet—where the <i>Prince of Peace</i> dwells? &quot;Christ in you&quot; (Col. 
    1:27). A holy heart may be compared to the doors of Solomon's temple, which 
    were made of olive tree, carved with open flowers (1 Kings 6:32). The olive 
    of peace and the open flowers of joy are in that heart.</p>
    <p align="justify">&quot;I have spoken these things to you so that My joy may be 
    in you and your joy may be complete.&quot; John 15:11. <b>Godliness does not 
    destroy a Christian's joy—but refines it. </b>His rose is without prickles, 
    his wine without froth. He who is a favorite of heaven must of necessity be 
    full of joy and peace. He may truly sing a sonnet to his soul and say, 
    &quot;Soul, take your ease&quot; (Luke 12:19). King Ptolemy asked someone how he might 
    be at rest when he dreamed. He replied, &quot;Let piety be the scope of all your 
    actions.&quot; If anyone should ask me how he should be at rest when he is awake, 
    I would return a similar answer: &quot;Let his soul be inlaid with godliness.&quot;</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">4. Godliness is the best trade we can engage in</p>
    </b></font><i>
    <p align="justify">It brings profit</i>. Wicked men say, &quot;It is vain to 
    serve God; and what profit is it?&quot; (Mal. 3:14). To be sure, there is no 
    profit in sin: &quot;Treasures of wickedness profit nothing&quot; (Proverbs 10:2). But 
    godliness is profitable (1 Tim. 4:8). It is like digging in a gold mine, 
    where there is gain, as well as toil. Godliness makes God himself our 
    portion: &quot;The Lord is the portion of my inheritance&quot; (Psalm 16:5). If God is 
    our portion—all our estate lies in jewels! Where God gives himself, he gives 
    everything else. Whoever has the castle, has all the royalties belonging to 
    it. God is a portion that can be neither spent nor lost. &quot;God is the 
    strength of my heart and my portion forever!&quot; (Psalm 73:26). Thus we see 
    that godliness is a thriving trade.</p>
    <p align="justify">And as godliness brings profit with it, so it is 
    profitable &quot;for all things&quot; (1 Tim. 4:8). What else is profitable, besides 
    godliness? Food will not give a man wisdom; gold will not give him health; 
    honor will not give him beauty. But godliness is useful for all things: it 
    fences off all troubles; it supplies all needs; it makes soul and body 
    completely happy.</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">5. Godliness is an enduring substance</p>
    </b></font><i>
    <p align="justify">It knows no fall of the leaf</i>. All <i>worldly </i>
    delights have a death's-head set on them. They are only <i>shadows </i>and 
    they are <i>fleeting</i>. Earthly comforts are like Paul's friends, who took 
    him to the ship and left him there (Acts 20:38). So these will bring a man 
    to his grave and then take their farewell. But godliness is a possession we 
    cannot be robbed of. It runs parallel with eternity. Force cannot weaken it; 
    age cannot wither it. It outbraves sufferings; it outlives death (Proverbs 
    10:2). Death may pluck the stalk of the body—but the <i>flower of grace </i>
    is not hurt.</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">6. Godliness is so excellent that the worst men would 
    like to have it, after they die</p>
    </b></font>
    <p align="justify">Though at present godliness is despised and under a 
    cloud—yet at death all would like to be godly. A philosopher asked a young 
    man whether he would like to be <i>rich </i>Croesus or <i>virtuous </i>
    Socrates. He answered that he would like to live with Croesus—and die with 
    Socrates. So men would like to live with the wicked in pleasure—but die with 
    the godly: &quot;Let me die the death of the righteous, and let my last end be 
    like his!&quot; (Numb. 23:10). If, then, godliness is so desirable at death, why 
    should we not pursue it now?</p>
    <h2><font COLOR="#0000ff"><b>
    <p align="justify">E. There are only a few godly people</p>
    </b></font></h2>
    <p align="justify">They are like the gleanings after vintage. Most receive 
    the mark of the beast (Rev. 13:17). The devil keeps open house for all 
    comers, and he is never without guests. This may prevail with us to be 
    godly. If the number of the saints is so small, how we should strive to be 
    found among these pearls! &quot;But a <i>remnant </i>shall be saved&quot; (Romans 
    9:27).<b> It is better to go to heaven with the few—than to hell in the 
    crowd!</b> Christ's flock is a little one. &quot;Don't be afraid, <i>little </i>
    flock, because your Father delights to give you the kingdom!&quot; Luke 12:32 </p>
    <h2><b><font COLOR="#0000ff">
    <p align="justify">F. Consider how vain and contemptible other things are, 
    which people void of godliness, busy themselves</font> <font COLOR="#0000ff">
    about</p>
    </font></b></h2>
    <p align="justify">Men are taken up with the things of this life, and &quot;what 
    profit has he who has labored for the wind?&quot; (Eccles. 5:16). Can the wind 
    fill? What is gold but dust (Amos 2:7), which will sooner choke than 
    satisfy?<i> Pull off the mask </i>of the most beautiful thing under the 
    sun—and look what is inside. There is <i>care </i>and <i>vexation!</i> And 
    the greatest care is still to come—and that is to give account to God. 
    Worldly joys are as fleeting as a bubble floating down the stream.</p>
    <p align="justify">But godliness has real worth in it. If you speak of true 
    honor, it is to be born of God; if of true valor, it is to fight the good 
    fight of faith; if of true delight, it is to have joy in the Holy Spirit. 
    Oh, then, espouse godliness! Here reality is to be had. Of other things we 
    may say, &quot;They comfort in vain!&quot; (Zech. 10:2)</p>

    </b></font><i>
    <p align="justify">Question:</i> But what shall we do, that we may be godly?</p>
    <i>
    <p align="justify">Answer:</i> I shall briefly lay down some rules or helps 
    to godliness.</p>
    <font COLOR="#0000ff"><b>
    <p align="justify">1. Be diligent in the use of all MEANS that may promote 
    godliness. </b></font>&quot;Strive to enter in at the strait gate&quot; (Luke 13:24). 
    What is <i>purpose</i>, without <i>pursuit</i>? When you have made your 
    estimate of godliness, pursue those means which are most expedient for 
    obtaining it.</p>
    <font COLOR="#0000ff"><b>
    <p align="justify">2. Take heed of the WORLD.</b></font> It is hard for a <i>
    clod of dust</i>—to become a <i>star</i>. &quot;Love not the world&quot; (1 John 
    2:15). Many would like to be godly—but the honors and profits of the world 
    divert them. <b>Where the world fills both head and heart—there is no room 
    for Christ. </b>He whose mind is rooted in the <i>earth, </i>is likely 
    enough to deride godliness. When our Savior was preaching against sin, &quot;the 
    Pharisees, who were covetous, derided him&quot; (Luke 16:14). The world eats the 
    heart out of godliness, as the ivy eats the heart out of the oak. The world 
    kills with her <i>golden </i>darts!</p>
    <font COLOR="#0000ff"><b>
    <p align="justify">3. Accustom yourselves to holy THOUGHTS.</b></font> <i>
    Serious meditation </i>represents everything in its true color. It shows the
    <i>evil of sin, </i>and the <i>luster of grace</i>. By holy thoughts, the 
    head grows clearer and the heart better: &quot;I <i>thought </i>on my ways, and
    <i>turned </i>my feet unto your testimonies&quot; (Psalm 119:59). If men would 
    step aside a little out of the noise and hurry of business, and spend only 
    half-an-hour every day thinking about their souls and eternity, it would 
    produce a wonderful alteration in them! </p>
    <font COLOR="#0000ff"><b>
    <p align="justify">4. Watch your HEARTS.</b></font> This was Christ's 
    watchword to his disciples: &quot;Watch, therefore&quot; (Matt. 24:42). The heart will 
    incline us to sin, before we are aware. A subtle heart needs a watchful eye. 
    Watch your thoughts, your affections. The heart has a thousand doors to run 
    out from. Oh, keep close watch on your souls! Stand continually on your 
    watch-towers (Hab. 2:1). When you have prayed against <i>sin</i>, watch 
    against <i>temptation</i>. Most wickedness in the world is committed for 
    lack of watchfulness. Watchfulness maintains godliness. It is <i>the edging
    </i>which keeps piety from fraying.</p>
    <font COLOR="#0000ff"><b>
    <p align="justify">5. Make spending your TIME a matter of conscience.</b></font> 
    &quot;Redeeming the time&quot; (Eph. 5:16). Many people fool away their time, some in 
    idle visits, others in recreations and pleasures which secretly bewitch the 
    heart and take it away from better things. What are our golden hours for—but 
    to attend to our souls? Time misspent is not time <i>lived</i>—but time <i>
    lost!</i> Time is a precious commodity. A piece of wax in itself is not 
    worth much—but when it is affixed to the <i>label of a will </i>and conveys 
    an estate, it is of great value. Thus, time simply in itself is not so 
    considerable—but as salvation is to be worked out in it, and a conveyance of 
    heaven depends on using it well—it is of infinite concern!</p>
    <font COLOR="#0000ff"><b>
    <p align="justify">6. Think of your SHORT STAY in the world.</b></font> &quot;We 
    are here for only a moment, visitors and strangers in the land as our 
    ancestors were before us. Our days on earth are like a shadow, gone so soon 
    without a trace!&quot; (1 Chron. 29:15). There is only a span between the cradle 
    and the grave. Solomon says there is a time to be <i>born </i>and a time to
    <i>die </i>(Eccles. 3:2)—but mentions no time of <i>living</i>—as if that 
    were so short it was not worth naming! Time, when it has once gone, cannot 
    be recalled. &quot;My life passes more swiftly than a runner. It flees away, 
    filled with tragedy. It disappears like a swift boat, like an eagle that 
    swoops down on its prey.&quot; Job 9:25-26. This Scripture compares time to a 
    flying eagle. Yet time differs from the eagle in this: the eagle flies 
    forward and then back again--but time has wings only to fly forward --it 
    never returns! &quot;Time flies irrevocably.&quot;</p>
    <p align="justify">The serious thoughts of our short stay here would be a 
    great means of promoting godliness. What if death should come before we are 
    ready? What if our life should breathe out before God's Spirit has breathed 
    in? Whoever considers how <i>flitting </i>and <i>winged </i>his life is—will 
    hasten his repentance!</p>
    <font COLOR="#0000ff"><b>
    <p align="justify">7. Make this maxim your own—that godliness is the purpose 
    of your creation. </b></font>God never sent men into the world only to eat 
    and drink and put on fine clothes—but that they might &quot;Serve him in holiness 
    and righteousness&quot; (Luke 1:74,75). God made the world only as a <i>dressing 
    room—</i>to dress our souls in. He sent us here on the grand errand of 
    godliness. Should nothing but the body (the brutish part) be looked after, 
    this would be basely to degenerate, yes, to invert and frustrate the very 
    purpose of our being!</p>
    <font COLOR="#0000ff"><b>
    <p align="justify">8. Be often among the godly. </b></font>They are the <i>
    salt </i>of the earth—and will help to <i>season </i>you. Their <i>counsel
    </i>may direct you; their <i>prayers </i>may enliven you. Such <i>holy 
    sparks </i>may be thrown into your breasts as may kindle devotion in you. It 
    is good to be among the saints, to learn the trade of godliness: &quot;He who 
    walks with wise men shall be wise&quot; (Proverbs 13:20).</p>

    <p align="justify">1. It is much to be lamented—to see professing Christians
    <i>wavering in religion</i>. How many we see unresolved and unsteady, like
    <i>Reuben</i>, &quot;unstable as water&quot; (Gen. 49:4). These the apostle rightly 
    compares to &quot;waves of the sea . . . and wandering stars&quot; (Jude 13). They are 
    not fixed in the principles of godliness. Beza writes of one Bolsechus, that 
    &quot;his religion changed like the moon.&quot; Such were the Ebionites, who kept <i>
    both </i>the Jewish and the Christian Sabbath. Many professors are like the 
    river Euripus, <i>ebbing </i>and <i>flowing </i>in matters of piety. They 
    are like reeds bending every way, either to the <i>Mass </i>or to the <i>
    Koran</i>. They are like the planet Mercury, which constantly varies, and is 
    seldom constant in its motion. When men think of heaven and the recompense 
    of reward, then they want to be godly—but when they think of persecution, 
    then they are like the Jews who deserted Christ and &quot;walked no more with 
    him&quot; (John 6:66). <b>If men's <i>faces </i>altered as fast as their <i>
    opinions</i>—we would not recognize them! </b>To be thus vacillating and 
    wavering in religion, argues lightness of thought. <i>Feathers </i>are blown 
    in every direction, and so are <i>feathery professors</i>.</p>
    <p align="justify">2. It is much to be lamented—to see professing Christians
    <i>falling from that godliness which once they seemed to have</i>. They have 
    turned to <i>worldliness </i>and <i>wantonness</i>. The very mantle of their 
    profession has fallen off; and indeed, if they were not <i>fixed </i>
    stars—it is no wonder to see them as <i>falling </i>stars. This spiritual 
    epilepsy, or falling sickness, was never more rife. </p>
    <p align="justify">It is a dreadful sin for men to fall from that godliness, 
    which they once seemed to have. Chrysostom says, &quot;Apostates are worse than 
    those who are openly wicked. They give godliness a bad name.&quot; &quot;The 
    apostate&quot;, says Tertullian, &quot;Seems to put God and Satan in the balance, and 
    having weighed both their services, prefers the devil's service, and 
    proclaims him to be the best master!&quot; In that respect the apostate is said 
    to put Christ to open shame (Heb. 6:6).</p>
    <p align="justify">This will be bitter in the end (Heb. 10:38). What a worm, 
    the apostate Spira felt in his conscience! In what horror of mind did the 
    apostate Stephen Gardiner cry out upon his deathbed—that with Peter, he had 
    denied his Master! But he had not repented with Peter!</p>
    <p align="justify">That we may be steadfast in godliness and persevere, let 
    us do two things:</p>
    <font COLOR="#0000ff"><b>
    <p align="justify">1. Let us TAKE HEED of those things which will make us by 
    degrees fall away from our profession.</b></font> Let us:</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">(1) Beware of COVETOUSNESS. </b></font>&quot;Men shall be 
    covetous . . . having a <i>form </i>of godliness—but denying the power&quot; (2 
    Tim. 3:2,5). One of Christ's own apostles was caught with this <i>silver 
    bait! </i>Covetousness will make a man betray a good <i>cause</i>, and make 
    shipwreck of a good <i>conscience</i>. I have read of some in the time of 
    the Emperor Valens, who denied the Christian faith to prevent the 
    confiscation of their goods.</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">(2) Beware of UNBELIEF.</b></font> &quot;Take heed, brethren, 
    lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the 
    living God&quot; (Heb. 3:12). There is no evil like an <i>evil </i>heart; no evil 
    heart like an <i>unbelieving </i>heart. Why so? It makes men depart from the 
    blessed God. He who does not believe God's mercy—will not dread his justice. 
    Unbelief is the nurse of apostasy; therefore unbelieving and unstable go 
    together: &quot;they believed not in God . . . they turned back and tempted God&quot; 
    (Psalm 78:22,41).</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">(3) Take heed of COWARDICE. </b></font>He who is afraid 
    to be godly, must surely be evil: &quot;The fear of man brings a snare&quot; (Proverbs 
    29:25). They who fear <i>danger </i>more than <i>sin</i>—will commit sin to 
    avoid danger! Origen, out of fear of persecution, offered incense to the 
    idol. Aristotle says, &quot;The reason why the chameleon turns so many colors, is 
    through excessive fear.&quot; Fear will make men change their religion, as often 
    as the chameleon does her color! Christian, you who have made a profession 
    of godliness so long, and others have noted you for a saint in their 
    calendar, why do you fear and begin to shrink back? The cause which you have 
    embarked on is good; you are fighting against sin; you have a good Captain 
    who is marching before you: Christ, &quot;the captain of your salvation&quot; (Heb. 
    2:10). </p>
    <p align="justify">What is it, that you fear? Is it loss of liberty? What is
    <i>liberty </i>worth, when <i>conscience </i>is in bonds? It is better to 
    lose your liberty and keep your peace—than to lose your peace and keep your 
    liberty. Is it loss of estate? Do you say, like Amaziah, &quot;What should I do 
    about the silver I paid?&quot; (2 Chron. 25:9) I would answer with the prophet, 
    &quot;The Lord can give you much more than this&quot; (v. 10). He has promised you &quot;an 
    hundredfold&quot; in this life—and if that is nothing, he will give you life 
    everlasting (Matt. 19:29).</p>
    <b><font COLOR="#0000ff">
    <p align="justify">2. Let us use all MEANS for perseverance</p>
    </font><font COLOR="#008000">
    <p align="justify">(1) Strive for a real work of grace in your soul. </font>
    </b>Grace is the best fortification: &quot;it is a good thing that the heart be 
    established with grace&quot; (Heb. 13:9).</p>
    <i>
    <p align="justify">Question:</i> What is this real work of grace?</p>
    <i>
    <p align="justify">Answer:</i> It consists in two things:</p>
    <p align="justify">1. Grace lies in <i>a heart-humbling work</i>. The thorn 
    of sin pricked Paul's conscience: &quot;Sin revived, and I died&quot; (Romans 7:9). 
    Though some are less humbled than others—as some bring forth children with 
    less pangs—yet all have pangs.</p>
    <p align="justify">2. Grace lies in <i>a heart-changing work.</i> &quot;But you 
    are washed—but you are sanctified&quot; (1 Cor. 6:11). A man is so changed as if 
    another soul lived in the same body! If ever you would hold out in the ways 
    of God, get this vital principle of grace. Why do men change their 
    religion—but because their hearts were never changed? They do not fall away 
    from grace—but for <i>lack </i>of grace.</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">(2) Be deliberate and judicious.</b></font> Weigh things 
    well in the balance: &quot;Who of you, wanting to build a tower, doesn't first 
    sit down and calculate the cost to see if he has enough to complete it?&quot; 
    (Luke 14:28). Think to yourselves, what it will cost you to be godly. You 
    must expect the hatred of the world (John 15:19). The wicked hate the godly 
    for their piety. It is strange that they should do so. Do we hate a flower 
    because it is sweet? The godly are hated for the perfume of their graces. Is 
    a virgin hated for her beauty? The wicked hate the godly for the beauty of 
    holiness which shines in them. Secret hatred will break forth into open 
    violence (2 Tim. 3:12). Christians must count the cost before they build. 
    Why are people so hasty in <i>abandoning </i>religion—if not because they 
    were so hasty in taking it up?</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">(3) Get a clear, distinct knowledge of God.</b></font> 
    Know the love of the <i>Father</i>, the merit of the <i>Son</i>, the 
    efficacy of the <i>Holy Spirit</i>. Those who do not know God aright, will 
    by degrees renounce their profession. The Samaritans sometimes sided with 
    the Jews, when they were in favor. Afterwards they disclaimed all kindred 
    with the Jews, when they were persecuted by Antiochus. And no wonder they 
    shuffled so in their religion, if you consider what Christ said of the 
    Samaritans, &quot;You Samaritans worship what you do not know!&quot; (John 4:22). They 
    were enveloped by ignorance. Blind men are apt to fall, and so are those who 
    are blinded in their minds.</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">(4) Enter on it purely out of choice. </b></font>&quot;I have 
    chosen the way of truth&quot; (Psalm 119:30). Espouse godliness for its own 
    worth. Whoever wishes to persevere must rather choose <i>godliness </i>with 
    reproach—than <i>sin </i>with all its worldly pomp. Whoever takes up 
    religion for fear—will lay it down again for fear. Whoever embraces 
    godliness for gain—will desert it when the jewels of promotion are pulled 
    off. Do not be godly from worldly design—but from pious choice.</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">(5) Strive for sincerity. </b></font>This will be a 
    golden pillar to support you. A tree that is <i>hollow</i>, must of 
    necessity be blown down. The hypocrite sets up in the trade of religion—but 
    he will soon break: &quot;their heart was not right with him, neither were they 
    steadfast&quot; (Psalm 78:37). Judas was first a sly hypocrite and then a 
    traitor. If a piece of copper is gilded, the gilding will wash off. Nothing 
    will hold out but sincerity: &quot;May integrity and honesty protect me, for I 
    put my hope in you&quot; (Psalm 25:21). How many <i>storms </i>was Job in! Not 
    only Satan—but God himself set on him (Job 7:20), which was enough to have 
    made him desist from being godly. Yet Job stood <i>fast</i>—because he stood
    <i>upright</i>: &quot;My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go; my 
    heart shall not reproach me as long as I live&quot; (Job 27:6). Those colors hold 
    best, which are fixed in oils. If we wish to have our profession hold its 
    color, it must be fixed in the oil of sincerity.</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">(6) Hold up the life and fervor of duty.</b></font> 
    &quot;Fervent in spirit, serving the Lord&quot; (Romans 12:11). We put coals on the 
    fire to keep it from going out. When Christians grow into a <i>dull 
    formality</i>, they begin to be dispirited, and by degrees abate in their 
    godliness. No one is so fit to make an apostate—as a lukewarm professing 
    Christian.</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">(7) Exercise great self-denial.</b></font> &quot;If anyone 
    would come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross daily and 
    follow me. (Luke 9:23). Self-ease, self-ends, whatever comes in competition 
    with (or stands in opposition to) Christ's glory and interest—must be 
    denied! Self is the great snare; self-love undermines the power of 
    godliness. The young man in the Gospel might have followed Christ—but 
    something of self hindered (Matt. 19:20-22). Self-love is self-hatred. The 
    man who cannot get beyond himself—will never get to heaven.</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">(8) Preserve a holy watchfulness over your hearts. </b>
    </font>The man who has gunpowder in his house, fears lest it should catch 
    fire and explode. Sin in the heart is like gunpowder; it may make us fear 
    lest a <i>spark of temptation </i>should fall on us and blow us up. There 
    are two things which may make us always watchful of our hearts: the <i>
    deceits </i>of our hearts and the <i>lusts </i>of our hearts. When Peter was 
    afraid that he should sink and cried to Christ, &quot;Lord, save me&quot;, then Christ 
    took him by the hand and helped him (Matt. 14:30,31); but when Peter grew 
    confident and thought he could stand alone, then Christ allowed him to fall. 
    Oh, let us be suspicious of ourselves and in a holy sense &quot;clothe ourselves 
    with trembling&quot; (Ezek. 26:16).</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">(9) Strive for assurance.</b></font> &quot;Give diligence to 
    make your calling and election sure&quot; (2 Pet. 1:10). The man who is sure that 
    God is <i>his </i>God, is like a castle built on a rock—all the powers of 
    hell cannot shake him. How can that man be <i>constant in piety</i>—who is 
    at a loss about his spiritual estate, and does not know whether he has grace 
    or not? It will be a difficult matter for a man to die for Christ, if he 
    does not know that Christ has died for him. Assurance establishes a 
    Christian in shaking times. He who has the Spirit of God bearing witness to 
    his heart is the most likely to bear witness to the truth (Romans 8:16). Oh, 
    give diligence! Be much in prayer, reading, holy conversation. These things 
    are the oil, without which the <i>lamp of assurance </i>will not shine.</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">(10) Lay hold of God's strength. </b></font>God is called 
    the Strength of Israel (1 Sam. 15:29). It is in his strength that we stand, 
    more than our own. The child is safest in the father's hands. It is not our 
    holding God—but his holding us—which preserves us. A little boat tied fast 
    to a rock is safe, and so are we, when we are tied to the &quot;rock of ages.&quot;

    <font COLOR="#ff0000" size="4"><b>
    <p align="center">MOTIVES to Persevere in Godliness</p>
    </b></font></h1>
    <p align="justify">So that I may encourage Christians to persevere in the 
    profession of godliness, I shall propose these four considerations:</p>
    <font COLOR="#0000ff"><b>
    <p align="justify">1. It is the glory and crown of a Christian to be 
    grey-headed in godliness</p>
    </b></font>
    <p align="justify">&quot;Mnason of Cyprus, an old disciple&quot; (Acts 21:16). What an 
    honor it is to see a Christian's <i>garments </i>red with blood—yet his <i>
    conscience </i>pure white and his graces green and flourishing!</p>
    <font COLOR="#0000ff"><b>
    <p align="justify">2. How sinners persevere in their sins!</p>
    </b></font>
    <p align="justify">They are settled on their lees (Zeph. 1:12). The 
    judgments of God will not deter or remove them. They say to their sin, as 
    Ruth said to Naomi, &quot;Where you go, I will go . . . the Lord do so to me, and 
    more also, if anything but death parts you and me&quot; (Ruth 1:16,17). So 
    nothing shall part men from their sins. Oh, what a shame it is that the 
    wicked should be fixed in <i>evil</i>—and we unfixed in <i>good</i>; that 
    they should be more constant in the <i>devil's </i>service—than we are in <i>
    Christ's </i>service!</p>
    <font COLOR="#0000ff"><b>
    <p align="justify">3. Our perseverance in godliness may be a means of 
    confirming others</p>
    </b></font>
    <p align="justify">Cyprian's hearers followed him to the place of his 
    suffering, and when they saw his steadfastness in the faith, they cried out, 
    &quot;Let us also die with our holy pastor!&quot; &quot;Many of the brethren, waxing 
    confident by my bonds, are much more bold to speak the word&quot; (Phil. 1:14). 
    Paul's zeal and constancy animated the onlookers. His prison chains made 
    converts in Nero's court—and two of those converts were afterwards martyrs, 
    as history relates.</p>
    <font COLOR="#0000ff"><b>
    <p align="justify">4. We shall lose nothing by our perseverance in godliness
    </p>
    </b></font>
    <p align="justify">There are eight glorious promises which God has entailed 
    on the persevering saints:</p>
    <p align="justify">(1) &quot;Be faithful, even to the point of death, and I will 
    give you the <b>crown of life</b>.&quot; (Rev. 2:10). Christian, you may lose the
    <i>breath </i>of life, but not the <i>crown </i>of life.</p>
    <p align="justify">(2) &quot;To him who overcomes, I will give the right to eat 
    from <b>the tree of life</b>, which is in the paradise of God&quot; (Rev. 2:7). 
    This tree of life is the Lord Jesus. This tree infuses life—and prevents 
    death. The day we eat of this tree—our eyes shall indeed be opened to see 
    God!</p>
    <p align="justify">(3) &quot;To him who overcomes, I will give some of the hidden 
    manna. I will also give him a white stone with a new name written on it, 
    known only to him who receives it.&quot; (Rev. 2:17). This promise consists of 
    three branches:</p>
    <p align="justify">(a) &quot;I will give to eat of the <b>hidden manna</b>.&quot; This 
    is <i>mysterious</i>. It signifies <i>the love of God—</i>which is manna for 
    sweetness and hidden for its rarity.</p>
    <p align="justify">(b) &quot;I will give him a <b>white stone</b>&quot;, that is, <i>
    absolution</i>. &quot;It may be called a precious stone,&quot; says Jerome.</p>
    <p align="justify">(c) &quot;And in the stone a<i> </i><b>new name</b>&quot;, that is,
    <i>adoption</i>. He shall be reputed an heir of heaven, and no one can know 
    it, except the one who has the privy seal of the Spirit to assure him of it.</p>
    <p align="justify">(4) &quot;He who overcomes will, like them, be <b>dressed in 
    white</b>. I will never blot out his name from the book of life, but will 
    acknowledge his name before my Father and his angels&quot; (Rev. 3:5). The 
    persevering saint shall be clothed in white. This is an emblem of joy 
    (Eccles. 9:8). He shall put off his mourning clothes, and be clothed in the 
    white robe of glory. </p>
    <p align="justify">&quot;I will never blot out his name from the book of life.&quot; 
    God will blot a believer's <i>sins </i>out—but he will not blot his <i>name
    </i>out. The book of God's decree has no errata in it. </p>
    <p align="justify">&quot;But I will acknowledge his name.&quot; If anyone has owned 
    Christ on earth and worn his colors when it was death to wear them, Christ 
    will not be ashamed of him—but will acknowledge his name before his Father 
    and the holy angels. Oh, what a comfort and honor it will be to have a good 
    look from Christ, at the last day! More—to have Christ own us by name and 
    say, &quot;These were those who stood up for my truth and kept their garments 
    pure, in a defiling age. These shall walk with me in white, for they are 
    worthy.&quot;</p>
    <p align="justify">(5) &quot;Him who overcomes I will make a <b>pillar in the 
    temple of my God</b>. Never again will he leave it. I will write on him the 
    name of my God and the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem, which 
    is coming down out of heaven from my God; and I will also write on him my 
    new name.&quot; (Rev. 3:12). There are many excellent things couched in this 
    promise: </p>
    <p align="justify">&quot;I will make him a pillar in the temple of my God.&quot; The 
    hypocrite is a reed shaken by the wind—but the conquering saint shall be a 
    glorious pillar, a pillar of strength and a pillar in the temple for 
    sanctity. </p>
    <p align="justify">&quot;Never again will he leave it.&quot; I understand this of a 
    glorified state. &quot;Never again will he leave it,&quot; that is, <i>after he has 
    overcome</i>, he shall not go out to the wars any more. He shall never have 
    any more sin or temptation to conflict with. No more noise of drum or cannon 
    shall be heard—but having won the field, the believer shall now stay at home 
    and divide the spoil. </p>
    <p align="justify">&quot;And I will write upon him the name of my God&quot;, that is, 
    he shall be openly acknowledged as my child, just as the Son bears his 
    Father's name. How honorable that saint must be, who has God's own name 
    written on him! </p>
    <p align="justify">&quot;And I will write upon him the name of the city of my 
    God&quot;, that is, he shall be enrolled as a citizen of the Jerusalem above. He 
    shall be made free in the angelic society.</p>
    <p align="justify">(6) &quot;To him who overcomes and does my will to the end, I 
    will give <b>authority over the nations</b>&quot; (Rev. 2:26). This may have a 
    double mystery. Either it may be understood of the saints living on earth: 
    they shall have power over the nations; their zeal and patience shall 
    overpower the adversaries of truth (Acts 6:10); or, principally, it may be 
    understood of the saints triumphing in heaven. They shall have power over 
    the nations: they shall share with Christ in some of his power; they shall 
    join with him in judging the world in the last days: &quot;the saints shall judge 
    the world&quot; (1 Cor. 6:2).</p>
    <p align="justify">(7) &quot;To him who overcomes, I will give the right to <b>
    sit with me on my throne</b>&quot; (Rev. 3:21):</p>
    <p align="justify">(a) Here is, first, the saints' dignity: they shall sit 
    upon the throne.</p>
    <p align="justify">(b) Their safety: they shall sit with Christ. Christ 
    holds them fast and no one shall pluck them off his throne. The saints may 
    be turned out of their houses—but they cannot be turned out of Christ's 
    throne! Men may as well pluck a star out of the sky—as a saint out of the 
    throne!</p>
    <p align="justify">(8) &quot;I will give him the <b>morning star</b>&quot; (Rev. 
    2:28). Though the saints may be sullied with reproach in this life, though 
    they may be termed factious and disloyal—Paul himself suffered trouble, in 
    the opinion of some, as an evildoer (2 Tim. 2:9)—yet God will bring forth 
    the saints' righteousness as the light, and they shall shine like the 
    morning star, which is brighter than the rest. &quot;I will give him the morning 
    star.&quot; This morning star is meant of Christ, as if Christ had said, &quot;I will 
    give the persevering saint some of my beauty; I will put some of my splendid 
    rays on him; he shall have the nearest degree of glory to me, as the morning 
    star is nearest the sun!</p>
    <p align="justify">Oh, what soul-ravishing promises there are here! Who 
    would not persevere in godliness! Whoever is not affected by these promises 
    is either a stone or a brute.<br>

    against Satan! You had lain many years soaking in wickedness, as if you had 
    been <i>parboiled for hell</i>—and then God laid you <i>steeping in Christ's 
    blood </i>and breathed holiness into your heart! Oh, what cause you have to 
    write yourselves down—as eternal debtors to free grace! He who does not give 
    God the praise for his grace denies that God is its author. Oh, acknowledge 
    the sovereign love of God! Admire distinguishing mercy! Set the crown of 
    your praise—on the head of free grace! If we are to be thankful for the 
    fruits of the <i>earth</i>, how much more for the fruits of the Spirit. It 
    is good that there is an eternity coming, when the saints shall triumph in 
    God and make his praise glorious!</p>

    <p align="justify">&quot;A bruised reed he will not break, and a smoldering wick 
    he will not snuff out, till he leads justice to victory.&quot; Matthew 12:20 </p>
    <p align="justify">This text is spoken prophetically of Christ. He will not 
    crow over the infirmities of his people; he will not crush grace in its 
    infancy. I begin with the first, &quot;<font COLOR="#ff0000"><b>the bruised reed</b></font>.&quot;
    </p>
    <i>
    <p align="justify">Question:</i> What is to be understood here by a <b>reed</b>?</p>
    <i>
    <p align="justify">Answer:</i> It is not to be taken literally—but 
    figuratively. It is a <i>rational </i>reed, the <i>spiritual </i>part of 
    man, the <i>soul</i>, which may well be compared to a reed—because it is 
    subject to imbecility and shaking in this life, until it grows up unto a 
    firm cedar in heaven.</p>
    <i>
    <p align="justify">Question:</i> What is meant by a <b>bruised reed</b>?</p>
    <i>
    <p align="justify">Answer:</i> It is a soul humbled and bruised by the sense 
    of sin. It weeps—but does not despair; it is tossed upon the <i>waves of 
    fear</i>—yet not without the <i>anchor of hope</i>.</p>
    <i>
    <p align="justify">Question:</i> What is meant by Christ's <b>not breaking</b> 
    this reed?</p>
    <i>
    <p align="justify">Answer:</i> The sense is that Christ will not discourage 
    any mournful spirit who is in the pangs of the new birth. If the <i>bruise 
    of sin </i>is felt, it shall not be mortal: &quot;A bruised reed shall he not 
    break.&quot; In the words there is an <i>understatement</i>; he will not break, 
    that is, he will bind up the bruised reed, he will comfort it.</p>
    <p align="justify">The result of the whole is to show Christ's compassion to 
    a poor dejected sinner who smites on his breast and dare hardly lift up his 
    eye for mercy. The heart of the Lord Jesus yearns for him; this bruised 
    reed, he will not break.</p>
    <p align="justify">In the text there are two parts: </p>
    <p align="justify">(1) A <b>supposition</b>: a soul penitentially bruised.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">(2) A <b>proposition</b>: it shall not be broken.</p>
    <i>
    <p align="justify">Doctrine:</i> The bruised soul shall not be broken: &quot;He 
    binds up their wounds&quot; (Psalm 147:3). For this purpose Christ received both 
    his mission and his unction, that he might bind up the bruised soul: &quot;the 
    Lord has anointed me to bind up the broken-hearted&quot; (Isaiah 61:1). But why 
    will Christ not break a bruised reed?</p>
    <p align="justify">1. <i>Out of the sweetness of his nature.</i> &quot;The Lord 
    is full of compassion and mercy&quot; (James 5:11). He begets compassion in other 
    creatures and is therefore called &quot;the Father of mercies&quot; (2 Cor. 1:3). And 
    surely he himself is not without compassion. When a poor soul is afflicted 
    in spirit, God will not exercise harshness towards it, lest he should be 
    thought to lay aside his own tender disposition.</p>
    <p align="justify">Hence it is, that the Lord has always been most 
    solicitous for his bruised ones. As the mother is most careful of her 
    children who are weak and sickly, &quot;He shall gather the lambs with his arm, 
    and carry them in his bosom&quot; (Isaiah 40:11). Those who have been spiritually 
    bruised, who like lambs are weakly and tender, Christ will carry in the arms 
    of free grace.</p>
    <p align="justify">2. <i>Because a contrite heart is his sacrifice</i>. 
    (Psalm 51:17). A bruised spirit sends forth tears which are like precious 
    wine (Psalm 56:8). A bruised soul is big with holy desires, yes, is 
    love-sick. Therefore, if a bruised reed has such virtue in it, Christ will 
    not break it. No spices, when they are bruised, are so fragrant to us—as a 
    contrite spirit is to God.</p>
    <p align="justify">3. <i>Because it so closely resembles Christ</i>. Jesus 
    Christ was once bruised on the cross: &quot;it pleased the Lord to bruise him&quot; 
    (Isaiah 53:10). His hands and feet were bruised with the nails; his side was 
    bruised with the spear. A bruised reed resembles a bruised Savior. No, a 
    bruised reed is a member of Christ; and though it is weak, Christ will not 
    cut it off—but will cherish it so much the more.</p>
    <p align="justify">(1) Will Christ not break the bruised reed?<b> This 
    tacitly implies that he will break unbruised reeds. </b>Those who were never 
    touched with trouble of spirit—but live and die in impenitence, are hard 
    reeds or, rather, rocks. Christ will not break a bruised reed—but he will 
    break a hard reed. Many do not know what it is to be bruised reeds. They are 
    bruised outwardly by affliction—but they are not bruised for sin. They never 
    knew what the pangs of the new birth meant. You will hear some thank God 
    that they were always at peace, they never had any anxiety of spirit. These 
    bless God for the greatest curse! Those who are not <i>bruised penitentially</i>—shall 
    be <i>broken judicially</i>. Those whose hearts would not break for 
    sin—shall break with despair. In hell there is nothing to be seen but a heap 
    of stones and a hammer. A heap of stones—that is hard hearts; a hammer—that 
    is God's power and justice, breaking them in pieces.</p>
    <p align="justify">A bruised reed he will not break, and a smoldering wick 
    he will not snuff out, till he leads justice to victory. Matthew 12:20 </p>
    <p align="justify">(2) Will Christ not break a bruised reed? <b>See, then, 
    the gracious disposition of Jesus Christ—he is full of mercy and sympathy.
    </b>Though he may <i>bruise </i>the soul for sin, he will not <i>break </i>
    it. The surgeon may <i>lance </i>the body and make it bleed—but he will <i>
    bind </i>up the wound. As Christ has <i>beams of majesty</i>, so he has a <i>
    heart of mercy</i>. Christ has both the <i>lion </i>and the <i>lamb </i>in 
    his escutcheon: the <b>lion</b>, in respect of his fierceness to the wicked 
    (Psalm 50:22), and the <b>lamb</b>, in respect of his mildness to his 
    people. His name is Jesus, a Savior, and his office is a healer (Mal. 4:2).
    <i>Christ made a plaster of his own blood—to heal a broken heart! </i>Christ 
    is the quintessence of love. Someone said, &quot;If the sweetness of all flowers 
    were in one flower, how sweet that flower would be!&quot; Christ is that flower. 
    How full of mercy is Christ, in whom all mercy meets! Christ has a <i>
    skillful hand </i>and a <i>tender heart</i>. &quot;He will not break a bruised 
    reed.&quot;</p>
    <p align="justify">Some are so full of harshness and cruelty, as to add 
    affliction to affliction, which is to lay a greater burden on a dying man. 
    But our Lord Jesus is a compassionate High Priest (Heb. 2:17). He is touched 
    with the feeling of our infirmity. Every bruise of the soul goes to his 
    heart! None refuse Christ—but such as do not know him. He is nothing but<i> 
    love incarnate! </i>He himself was bruised to heal those who are bruised.</p>
    <b>
    <p align="justify">(3) </b>Will Christ not break a bruised reed? <b>See, 
    then, what encouragement there is here for faith! </b>Had Christ said that 
    he would break the bruised reed, then indeed there would be ground for 
    despair. But when Christ said that he will not break a bruised reed—this 
    opens a door of hope for humble, bruised souls! If we can say that we have 
    been bruised for sin, why do we not believe? Why do we droop under our fears 
    and discouragements, as if there were no mercy for us? Christ says, &quot;He 
    heals the broken in heart&quot; (Psalm 147:3). &quot;No,&quot; says unbelief, &quot;he will not 
    heal <i>me.&quot; Christ </i>says that he will <i>cure </i>the bruised soul. 
    &quot;No,&quot; says unbelief, &quot;he will <i>kill </i>it.&quot; As unbelief makes our 
    comforts void, so it tries to make the Word void, as if all God's promises 
    were but forgeries. Has the Lord said that he will not break a bruised reed? 
    Can truth lie? Oh, what a sin unbelief is! Some think it dreadful to be 
    among the number of drunkards, swearers and whoremongers. Let me tell you, 
    it is no less dreadful to be among the number of unbelievers (Rev. 21:8). 
    Unbelief is worse than any other sin, because it brings God, his Word, and 
    his promises into suspicion. It robs him of the richest jewel in his crown, 
    which is his truth: &quot;He who believes not God, has made him a liar&quot; (1 John 
    5:10).</p>
    <p align="justify">Oh then, let all humbled sinners go to Jesus Christ. 
    Christ was bruised with <i>desertion</i>, to heal those who are bruised with
    <i>sin</i>. If you can show Christ your sores and touch him by faith—you 
    shall be healed of all your soul bruises! Will Christ not break you? Then do 
    not undo yourself by despair.</p>
    <font COLOR="#0000ff"><b>
    <p align="justify">Use 1:</b></font> Will Jesus Christ not break a bruised 
    reed? Then it reproves those who do what they can, to break the bruised 
    reed. And they are such as try to hinder the work of conversion in others. 
    When they see them wounded and troubled for sin, they dishearten them, 
    telling them that piety is a sour, melancholy thing; and they had better 
    return to their former pleasures. When an <i>arrow of conviction</i> is shot 
    into their conscience, these pull it out again, and will not allow the work 
    of conviction to go forward. Thus, when the soul is almost bruised, they 
    hinder it from a thorough bruise. This is for <i>men </i>to be <i>devils </i>
    to others. If to shed the <i>blood </i>of another makes a man guilty, what 
    is it to <i>damn another's soul?</p>

    <p align="justify">Use 2: </b></font><i>This text is a spiritual honeycomb, 
    dropping consolation into all bruised hearts.</i> As we give stimulants to a 
    body suffering from a fainting fit, so when sinners are bruised for their 
    sins, I shall give some stimulant to revive them. This text is comforting to 
    a poor soul who sits with Job among the ashes, and is dejected at the sense 
    of its unworthiness. &quot;Ah!&quot; says the soul, &quot;I am unworthy of mercy; what am 
    I, that ever God should look on me? Those who have greater gifts and graces 
    perhaps may obtain a look from God—but alas! <i>I </i>am unworthy.&quot; Does 
    your unworthiness trouble you? What more unworthy than a bruised reed? Yet 
    there is a promise made to that condition: &quot;a bruised reed he will not 
    break.&quot; The promise is not made to the fig <i>tree </i>or olive <i>tree</i>, 
    which are fertile plants—but to the bruised <i>reed</i>. Though you are 
    despicable in your own eyes, a poor shattered reed—yet you may be glorious 
    in the eyes of the Lord. Do not let your unworthiness discourage you.<i> If

    Christ will not break you—but will bind up your wounds.</p>
    <i>
    <p align="justify">Question:</i> But how shall I know that I am <i>savingly 
    bruised?</p>
    <p align="justify">Answer:</i> Did God ever bring you to your knees? Has 
    your proud heart been humbled? Did you ever see yourself as a sinner and 
    nothing but a sinner? Did you ever, with a weeping eye, look on Christ? 
    (Zech. 12:10) And did those tears drop from the eye of faith? (Mark 9:24) 
    This is gospel bruising. Can you say, &quot;Lord, though I do not see you—yet I 
    love you; though I am in the dark—yet I cast anchor on you!&quot; This is to be a 
    bruised reed.</p>
    <i>
    <p align="justify">Objection</i> 1: But I fear I am not bruised enough.</p>
    <i>
    <p align="justify">Answer:</i> It is hard to prescribe a just measure of 
    humiliation. It is the same in the new birth as in the natural. Some give 
    birth with more pangs, and some with fewer. But would you like to know when 
    you are bruised enough? When your spirit is so troubled that you are willing 
    to let go those lusts which brought in the greatest income of pleasure and 
    delight. When not only is sin discarded but you are disgusted with it, then 
    you have been bruised enough. The medicine is strong enough when it has 
    purged out the disease. The soul is bruised enough when the love of sin is 
    purged out.</p>
    <i>
    <p align="justify">Objection</i> 2: But I fear I am not bruised as I should 
    be. I find my heart so hard.</p>
    <i>
    <p align="justify">Answer</i> 1. We must distinguish between <i>hardness of 
    heart</i> and a <i>hard heart</i>. The best heart may have some hardness—but 
    though there is some hardness in it, it is not a hard heart. Names are given 
    according to the better part. If we come into a field that has tares and 
    wheat in it, we do not call it a field of tares, but a wheat field. So 
    though there is hardness in the heart as well as softness—yet God, who 
    judges by that part which is more excellent, looks on it as a soft heart.</p>
    <i>
    <p align="justify">Answer</i> 2: There is a great difference between the 
    hardness in the wicked, and hardness in the godly. The one is natural, the 
    other is only accidental. The hardness in a wicked man is like the hardness 
    of a stone, which is an innate continued hardness. The hardness in a child 
    of God, is like the hardness of ice, which is soon melted by the sunbeams. 
    Perhaps God has at present withdrawn his Spirit, so the heart is congealed 
    like ice. But let God's Spirit, like the sun, return and shine on the heart, 
    and then it has a gracious thaw on it and it melts in love.</p>
    <i>
    <p align="justify">Answer</i> 3: Do you not grieve under your hardness? You 
    sigh for lack of groans, you weep for lack of tears. The hard reed cannot 
    weep. If you were not a bruised reed, all this weeping could not come from 
    you.</p>
    <i>
    <p align="justify">Objection</i> 3: But I am a <i>barren </i>reed; I bear no 
    fruit; therefore I fear I shall be broken.</p>
    <i>
    <p align="justify">Answer:</i> Gracious hearts are apt to overlook the good 
    that is in them. They can spy the <i>worm </i>in the leaf—but not the <i>
    fruit</i>. Why do you say you are barren? If you are a bruised reed, you are 
    not barren. The spiritual reed ingrafted into the true vine is fruitful. 
    There is so much sap in Christ that it makes all who are ingrafted into him 
    bear fruit. Christ distills grace like drops of dew on the soul: &quot;I will be 
    as the dew unto Israel; he shall grow as the lily; his branches shall 
    spread, and his beauty shall be as the olive tree&quot; (Hos. 14:5,6). The God 
    who made the dry <i>rod </i>blossom—will make the dry <i>reed </i>flourish.</p>
    <p align="justify">So much for the first expression in the text. I proceed 
    to the second: &quot;<font COLOR="#ff0000"><b>the smoking flax shall he not 
    quench</b></font>.&quot; </p>
    <i>
    <p align="justify">Question:</i> What is meant by <b>smoking</b>?</p>
    <i>
    <p align="justify">Answer:</i> By smoke is meant corruption. Smoke is 
    offensive to the eye, so sin offends the pure eye of God. </p>
    <i>
    <p align="justify">Question:</i> What is meant by <b>smoking flax</b>?</p>
    <i>
    <p align="justify">Answer:</i> It means grace mingled with corruption. As 
    with a little fire there may be much smoke, so with a little grace there may 
    be much corruption.</p>
    <i>
    <p align="justify">Question:</i> What is meant by Christ's not quenching the 
    smoking flax?</p>
    <i>
    <p align="justify">Answer:</i> The meaning is that though there is only a 
    spark of grace with much sin, Christ will not put out this spark. In the 
    words there is a figure; &quot;he will not quench&quot;, that is, he will increase. 
    Nothing is easier than to quench smoking flax; the least touch does it. But 
    Christ will not quench it. He will not blow the spark of grace out—but will 
    blow it up into a flame, he will make this smoking flax into a burning 
    candle.</p>
    <i>
    <p align="justify">Doctrine:</i> That <b>a little grace mixed with much 
    corruption shall not be quenched. </b>For the illustrating of this I shall 
    show you:</p>
    <p align="justify">1. That a little grace is often mixed with much 
    corruption.</p>
    <p align="justify">2. That this little grace mixed with corruption shall not 
    be quenched.</p>
    <p align="justify">3. The reasons for the proposition.</p>
    <font COLOR="#0000ff"><b>
    <p align="justify">1. Often in the godly, a little grace is mingled with 
    much corruption</p>
    </b></font>
    <p align="justify">&quot;Lord, I believe&quot;—there was some faith; &quot;help my 
    unbelief&quot; (Mark 9:24)—there was corruption mixed with it. There are, in the 
    best saints, inter-weavings of sin and grace: a dark side with the light; 
    much pride mixed with humility; much earthliness with heavenliness. Grace in 
    the godly smacks of an old crabtree stock.</p>
    <p align="justify">No, in many of the regenerate there is more corruption 
    than grace. So much smoke that you can scarcely discern any fire; so much 
    distrust that you can hardly see any faith (1 Sam. 27:1); so much passion 
    that you can hardly see any meekness. Jonah, a peevish prophet, quarrels 
    with God, no, he justifies his passion: &quot;I do well to be angry, even unto 
    death!&quot; (Jonah 4:9). Here there was so much passion that it was hard to see 
    any grace. A Christian in this life is like a glass that has more froth than 
    wine, or like a diseased body that has more illness than vigor. It may 
    humble the best to consider how much corruption is interlarded with their 
    grace.</p>
    <font COLOR="#0000ff"><b>
    <p align="justify">2. This little grace mixed with much corruption shall not 
    be quenched</p>
    </b></font>
    <p align="justify">&quot;The smoking flax he will not quench.&quot; The disciples&quot; 
    faith was at first only small: &quot;they forsook Christ, and fled&quot; (Matt. 
    26:56). Here there was smoking flax—but Christ did not quench that little 
    grace but nourished and animated it. Their faith afterwards grew stronger 
    and they openly confessed Christ (Acts 4:29,30). Here the flax was flaming.</p>
    <font COLOR="#0000ff"><b>
    <p align="justify">3. The reasons why Christ will not quench the smoking 
    flax</p>
    </b></font><font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">(1) Because this little spark which is in the smoking 
    flax, is of divine production.</b></font> It comes from the Father of 
    lights, and the Lord will not quench the work of his own grace. Everything 
    by the instinct of nature will preserve its own. The hen that hatches her 
    young will preserve and nourish them; she will not destroy them as soon as 
    they are hatched. God, who has put this tenderness into the creature to 
    preserve its young, will much more nourish the work of his own Spirit in the 
    heart. Will he light up the lamp of grace in the soul—and then put it out? 
    This would be neither for his interest—nor for his honor.</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">(2) Christ will not quench the beginnings of grace, 
    because a <i>little </i>grace is as precious as much <i>grace</i>.</b></font> 
    A small pearl is of value. Though the pearl of faith is little—yet if it is 
    a true pearl, it shines gloriously in God's eyes. A goldsmith takes account 
    of the least <i>filings </i>of gold, and will not throw them away. The pupil 
    of the eye is only little—yet it is of great use; it can at once view a huge 
    part of the heavens. A little faith can justify. A weak hand can tie the 
    nuptial knot. A weak faith can unite to Christ—as well as a strong faith. A 
    little grace makes us like God. A silver penny bears the king's image on it, 
    as well as a larger coin. The least grain of grace bears God's image on 
    it—and will God destroy his own image? When the temples in Greece were 
    demolished, Xerxes caused the temple of Diana to be preserved for the beauty 
    of its structure. When God destroys all the glory of the world and sets it 
    on fire—yet he will not destroy the least grace, because it bears a print of 
    his own likeness on it. That little spark in the smoking flax, is a ray and 
    beam of God's own glory.</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">(3) Christ will not quench the smoking flax, because this 
    little light in the flax may grow into a flame.</b></font> Grace is compared 
    to a grain of mustard seed; it is the smallest of all seeds—but when it has 
    grown, it is the largest of herbs, and becomes a tree (Matt. 13:31,32). The 
    greatest grace was once little. The oak was once an acorn. The most renowned 
    faith in the world, was once in its spiritual infancy. The greatest flame of 
    zeal was once only smoking flax. Grace, like the waters of the sanctuary, 
    rises higher (Ezek. 47:1-5). If, then, the smallest embryo and seed of 
    holiness has a ripening and growing nature, the Lord will not allow it to be 
    abortive.</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">(4) Christ will not quench the smoking flax, because when 
    he preserves a little light in a great deal of smoke—here the glory of his 
    power shines forth.</b></font> The trembling soul thinks it will be 
    swallowed up by sin. But God preserves a little quantity of grace in the 
    heart—no, no, he makes that spark prevail over corruption, as the fire from 
    heaven &quot;licked up the water in the trench&quot; (1 Kings 18:38). So God gets 
    himself a glorious name and carries away the trophies of honor: &quot;My strength 
    is made perfect in weakness&quot; (2 Cor. 12:9).</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">1. See the different dealings of God and men.</b></font> 
    Men, for a little smoke—will quench a great deal of light; God, for a great 
    deal of smoke—will not quench a little light. It is the manner of the world, 
    if they see a little failure in another, to pass by and quench a great deal 
    of worth because of that failure. This is our nature, to aggravate a little 
    fault and diminish a great deal of virtue; to see the infirmities and darken 
    the excellences of others—as we take more notice of the <i>twinkling </i>of 
    a star, than the <i>shining </i>of a star. We censure others for their 
    passion—but do not admire them for their piety. Thus, because of a little 
    smoke that we see in others, we quench much light.</p>
    <p align="justify">God does not act like that. For a great deal of smoke, he 
    will not quench a little light. He sees the sincerity—and overlooks many 
    infirmities. The least sparks of grace he nourishes, and blows them gently 
    with the breath of his Spirit until they break forth into a flame!</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">2. If Christ will not quench the smoking flax—then we 
    must not quench the smoking flax in ourselves. </b></font>If grace does not 
    increase into so great a flame as we see in others, and we therefore 
    conclude that we have no fire of the Spirit in us—that is to quench the 
    smoking flax and to bear false witness against ourselves. As we must not 
    credit false evidence, so neither must we deny true evidences of godliness. 
    As fire may be hidden in the embers, so grace may be hidden under many 
    disorders of soul. Some Christians are so skillful at this—accusing 
    themselves for lack of grace—as if they had received a fee from Satan to 
    plead for him against themselves.</p>
    <p align="justify">It is a great mistake to argue from the <i>weakness </i>
    of grace—to its <i>absence</i>. It is one thing to be <i>weak </i>in 
    faith—and another to <i>lack </i>faith. He whose eyesight is dim has 
    defective sight—but he is not without sight. <b>A little grace is grace, 
    though it is smothered under much corruption.</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050">
    <p align="justify">3. If the least spark of grace shall not be quenched, 
    then it follows as a great truth—that there is no falling from grace. </font>
    </b>If the least grain of grace should perish, then the smoking flax would 
    be quenched. Grace may be <i>shaken </i>by fears and doubts—but not torn up 
    by the roots. I grant that <i>seeming </i>grace may be lost; this wildfire 
    may be blown out—but not the fire of the Spirit's kindling. Grace may be <i>
    dormant </i>in the soul—but not <i>dead</i>. As a man in a coma does not 
    exert vital energy, grace may be <i>eclipsed</i>, not <i>extinct</i>. A 
    Christian may lose his <i>comfort</i>, like a tree in autumn which has shed 
    its fruit—but there is still sap in the vine and &quot;the seed of God remains in 
    him&quot; (1 John 3:9). Grace is a flower of eternity.</p>
    <p align="justify">This smoking flax cannot be quenched by affliction—but is 
    like those trees of which Pliny writes—trees growing in the Red Sea, which 
    though beaten by the waves, stand immovable, and though sometimes covered 
    with water, flourish the more. Grace is like a true oriental diamond—which 
    sparkles and cannot be broken.</p>
    <p align="justify">I confess it is a matter of astonishment, that grace 
    should not be wholly annihilated, especially if we consider two things:</p>
    <p align="justify">(1) The malice of Satan. He is a malignant spirit and 
    lays barriers in our way to heaven. The devil, with the <i>wind of 
    temptation</i>, tries to blow out the spark of grace in our hearts. If this 
    will not do, he stirs up wicked men and raises the militia of hell against 
    us. What a wonder it is that this bright star of grace, should not be swept 
    down by the tail of the dragon!</p>
    <p align="justify">(2) The world of corruption in our hearts. Sin makes up 
    the major part in a Christian. There are more dregs than grace in the 
    holiest heart. The heart swarms with sin. What a great deal of pride and 
    atheism there is in the soul! Now is it not astonishing that this <i>lily of 
    grace </i>should be able to grow among so many <i>thorns</i>? It is as great 
    a wonder that a little grace should be preserved in the midst of so much 
    corruption—as to see a candle burning in the sea and not extinguished.</p>
    <p align="justify">But though grace lives with so much difficulty, like the 
    infant that struggles for breath—yet being born of God, it is immortal. 
    Grace conflicting with corruption is like a ship tossed and beaten by the 
    waves—yet it weathers the storm and at last gets to the desired haven. If 
    grace should expire, how could this text be verified, &quot;The smoking flax he 
    will not quench&quot;?</p>
    <i>
    <p align="justify">Question:</i> But how is it that grace, even the least 
    degree of it, is not quenched?</p>
    <i>
    <p align="justify">Answer:</i> It is from the mighty operation of the Holy 
    Spirit. The Spirit of God, who is the source, continually excites and 
    awakens grace in the heart. He is at work in a believer every day. He pours 
    in oil, and keeps the lamp of grace burning. Grace is compared to a river of 
    life (John 7:38). The river of grace can never be dried up, for the Spirit 
    of God is the spring which feeds it.</p>
    <p align="justify">Now it is evident from the covenant of grace, that the 
    smoking flax cannot be quenched. &quot;The mountains shall depart, and the hills 
    be removed; but the covenant of my peace shall not be removed, says the 
    Lord&quot; (Isaiah 54:10). If there is falling from grace, how is it an immovable 
    covenant? If grace dies and the smoking flax is quenched, how is our state 
    in Christ, better than it was in Adam? The covenant of grace is called &quot;a 
    better covenant&quot; (Heb. 7:22). How is it a better covenant than that which 
    was made with Adam? Not only because it has a better Surety and contains 
    better privileges—but because it has better conditions annexed to it: &quot;It is 
    ordered in all things, and <i>sure</i>&quot; (2 Sam. 23:5). Those who are taken 
    into the covenant shall be like stars fixed in their orbit and shall never 
    fall away. If grace might die and be quenched, then it would not be a better 
    covenant.</p>
    <i>
    <p align="justify">Objection:</i> But we are bidden not to quench the Spirit 
    (1 Thess. 5:19), which implies that the grace of the Spirit may be lost and 
    the smoking flax quenched.</p>
    <i>
    <p align="justify">Answer:</i> We must distinguish between the <i>common </i>
    work of the Spirit and the <i>sanctifying </i>work. The one may be quenched, 
    but not the other. The common work of the Spirit is like a picture drawn on 
    the ice, which is soon defaced; the sanctifying work is like a statue carved 
    in gold, which endures. The <i>gifts </i>of the Spirit may be quenched, but 
    not the grace of the Spirit. There is the <i>enlightening </i>of the Spirit, 
    and the <i>anointing</i>. The <i>enlightening </i>of the Spirit may fail—but 
    the <i>anointing </i>of the Spirit abides: &quot;the anointing which you have 
    received from him abides in you&quot; (1 John 2:27). The hypocrite's blaze goes 
    out, the true believer's spark lives and flourishes. The one is the light of 
    a comet which wastes and evaporates (Matt. 25:8); the other is the light of 
    a star which retains its luster.</p>
    <p align="justify">From all that has been said, let a saint of the Lord be 
    persuaded to do these two things:</p>
    <p align="justify">1. To believe his privilege.</p>
    <p align="justify">2. To pursue his duty.</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">1. To believe his privilege</p>
    </b></font>
    <p align="justify">It is the incomparable and unparalleled happiness of a 
    saint, that his coal of grace shall not be quenched (2 Sam. 14:7). That 
    grace in his soul which is weak and languid, shall not die—but recover its 
    strength and increase. The Lord will make the smoking flax into a burning 
    lamp. It would be very sad for a Christian to be continually chopping and 
    changing: one day a member of Christ and the next day a limb of Satan; one 
    day to have grace shine in his soul and the next day his light be put out in 
    obscurity. This would spoil a Christian's comfort and break asunder the 
    golden chain of salvation. But be assured, O Christian, that he who has 
    begun a good work, will ripen it to perfection (Phil. 1:6). Christ will send 
    forth judgment unto victory. He will make grace victorious over all opposing 
    corruption. If grace should finally perish, what would become of the smoking 
    flax? And how would that title properly be given to Christ, &quot;Finisher of the 
    faith&quot; (Heb. 12:2)?</p>
    <i>
    <p align="justify">Objection:</i> There is no question that this is an 
    undoubted privilege to those who are smoking flax and have the least 
    beginnings of grace—but I fear I am not smoking flax; I cannot see the light 
    of grace in myself.</p>
    <i>
    <p align="justify">Answer:</i> So that I may comfort the smoking flax, why 
    do you thus dispute against yourself? What makes you think you have no 
    grace? I believe you have more than you would be willing to part with. You 
    value grace above the gold of Ophir. How could you see the worth and luster 
    of this jewel—if God's Spirit had not opened your eyes? You desire to 
    believe and mourn—that you cannot believe. Are these tears not the 
    beginnings of faith? You desire Christ and cannot be satisfied without him. 
    This <i>beating of the pulse </i>evidences life. The iron could not move 
    upwards if the loadstone did not draw it. The heart could not ascend in holy 
    desires for God, if some heavenly loadstone had not been drawing it. 
    Christian, can you say that sin is your burden, Christ is your delight and, 
    as Peter once said, &quot;Lord, you know that I love you!&quot; (John 21:17) This is 
    smoking flax and the Lord will not quench it. Your <i>grace </i>shall 
    flourish into <i>glory</i>. God will sooner extinguish the light of the sun, 
    than extinguish the dawning light of his Spirit in your heart.</p>
    <font COLOR="#008000"><b>
    <p align="justify">2. To pursue his duty</p>
    </b></font>
    <p align="justify">There are two duties required of believers:</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">(1) Love.</b></font> Will the Lord not quench the smoking 
    flax—but make it at last victorious over all opposition? How the smoking 
    flax should flame in love to God! &quot;Oh, love the Lord, all his saints&quot; (Psalm 
    31:23). The saints owe much to God, and when they have nothing to <i>pay</i>, 
    it is hard if they cannot <i>love </i>him. O you saints, it is God who 
    carries on grace progressively in your souls. He is like a father who gives 
    his son a small stock of money to begin with, and when he has traded a 
    little, he adds more to the stock. So God adds continually to your stock. He 
    drops oil into <i>the lamp of your grace </i>every day, and so keeps the 
    lamp burning. This may inflame your love to God, who will not let the work 
    of grace fail but will bring it to perfection: &quot;the smoking flax he will not 
    quench.&quot; How God's people should long for heaven, when it will be their 
    constant work to breathe out love and sound out praise!</p>
    <font COLOR="#b07050"><b>
    <p align="justify">(2) Labor.</b></font> Some may think that if Christ will 
    not quench the smoking flax—but make it burn brighter to the meridian of 
    glory, then we need take no pains but leave God to do his own work. Take 
    heed of drawing so bad a conclusion from such good premises. What I have 
    spoken is to encourage faith—not to indulge sloth! Do not think God will do 
    our work for us—while we sit still. As <i>God </i>will blow up the spark of 
    grace by his Spirit—so <i>we </i>must be blowing it up by holy efforts. God 
    will not bring us to heaven <i>sleeping—</i>but<i> praying</i>. The Lord 
    told Paul that all in the ship would come safely to shore—but it must be by 
    the use of means: &quot;Except these abide in the ship, you cannot be saved&quot; 
    (Acts 27:31). So the saints shall certainly arrive at salvation. They shall 
    come to shore at last—but they must stay in the ship, in the use of 
    ordinances, else they cannot be saved. Christ assures his disciples: &quot;None 
    shall pluck them out of my hand&quot; (John 10:28). But he still gives that 
    counsel, &quot;Watch and pray, that you enter not into temptation&quot; (Matt. 26:41). 
    The seed of God shall not die—but we must water it with our tears. The 
    smoking flax shall not be quenched—but we must blow it up with the breath of 
    our effort.</p>
    <p align="justify">The second comfort to the godly is that godliness 
    promotes them to a close and glorious union with Jesus Christ. But I reserve 
    this for the next chapter.</p>

&nbsp;</p>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
    <p align="justify">In this <i>Song of Songs </i>we see the love of Christ and his 
    church running towards each other in a full torrent.</p>
    <p align="justify">The text contains three general parts: </p>
    <p align="justify">1. A symbol of affection: &quot;My beloved.&quot; </p>
    <p align="justify">2. A term of appropriation: &quot;is mine.&quot; </p>
    <p align="justify">3. A holy resignation: &quot;I am his.&quot;</p>
        </font>
        <p align="justify"><font FACE="Verdana">Doctrine: <b>There is a marital 
        union between Christ and believers</b>. The apostle, having treated at 
        large of marriage, winds up the whole chapter thus: &quot;This is a great 
        mystery—but I speak concerning <i>Christ </i>and the <i>church</i>&quot; 
        (Eph. 5:32). What is closer than union? What sweeter? There is <b>a 
        twofold union</b> with Christ: </p>
        <p align="justify">1. A <u>natural</u> union. This all men have, Christ 
        having taken their nature on him and not that of the angels (Heb. 2:16). 
        But if there is no more than this natural union, it will give little 
        comfort. Thousands are damned—though Christ is united to their nature.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">2. A <u>sacred</u> union. By this we are mystically 
        united to Christ. The union with Christ is not personal. If Christ's 
        essence were transfused into the person of a believer, then it would 
        follow that all that a believer does should be meritorious. </p>
        <p align="justify">But the union between Christ and a saint is: </p>
        <p align="justify">(a) <u>Federal</u>: &quot;My beloved is mine.&quot; God the 
        Father gives the bride; God the Son receives the bride; God the Holy 
        Spirit ties the knot in marriage—he knits our wills to Christ and 
        Christ's love to us. </p>
        <p align="justify">(b) <u>Effectual</u>. Christ unites himself to his 
        spouse <i>by his graces and influences</i>: &quot;of his fullness have all we 
        received, and grace for grace&quot; (John 1:16). Christ makes himself one 
        with the spouse by <i>conveying his image and stamping the impress of 
        his own holiness upon her!</p>
        </i>
        <p align="justify">This union with Christ may well be called <u>mystical</u>. 
        It is hard to describe the manner of it. It is hard to show how the soul 
        is united to the body—and how Christ is united to the soul. But though 
        this union is <i>spiritual</i>—it is <i>real</i>. Things in nature often 
        work insensibly, yet really (Eccles. 11:5). We do not see the hand move 
        on the sun-dial, yet it moves. The sun exhales and draws up the vapors 
        of the earth insensibly yet really. So the union between Christ and the 
        soul—though it is <i>imperceptible </i>to the eye of reason—is still <i>
        real </i>(1 Cor. 6:17). </p>
        <i>
        <p align="justify">Before this union with Christ there must be a <b>
        separation</b></i>. The heart must be <i>separated from all other lovers</i>, 
        as in marriage there is a leaving of father and mother: &quot;Forget your own 
        people, and your father's house.&quot; (Psalm 45:10). So there must be <i>a 
        leaving of our former sins, a breaking off the old league with hell 
        before we can be united to Christ</i>. &quot;Ephraim shall say, What have I 
        to do any more with idols?&quot; (Hos. 14:8), or as it is in the Hebrew, 
        &quot;with sorrows.&quot; <i>Those sins which were looked on before as <b>lovers</b>, 
        are now <b>sorrows</b></i>. There must be a divorce, before a union. </p>
        <b>
        <p align="justify">The purpose of our marital union with Christ</b> is 
        twofold: </p>
        <p align="justify">1. <u>Co-habitation</u>. This is one purpose of 
        marriage, <i>to live together</i>: &quot;that Christ may <b>dwell</b> in your 
        hearts&quot; (Eph. 2:17). It is not enough to pay Christ a few complimentary 
        visits in his ordinances—hypocrites may do so—but there must be a mutual 
        associating. We must dwell upon the thoughts of Christ: &quot;he who <b>
        abides</b> in God&quot; (I John 3:24). Married people should not live apart.
        </p>
        <p align="justify">2. <u>Fruit bearing</u>: &quot;That you may be married to 
        another; to Him who was raised from the dead—that we <i>should bear 
        fruit to God</i>.&quot; (Rom. 7:4). The spouse bears the fruits of the 
        Spirit: love, joy, peace, patience, gentleness (Gal. 5:22). <i>
        Barrenness</i> is a shame in Christ's spouse!</p>
        <p align="justify">This marriage union with Christ is <b>the most noble 
        and excellent union</b>: </p>
        <p align="justify">(a) <u>Christ unites himself to many</u>. In other 
        marriages only <i>one </i>person is taken—but here <i>millions </i>are 
        taken! Otherwise, poor souls might cry out, &quot;Alas! Christ has married 
        So-and-so, but what is that to me? I am left out.&quot; No, <i>Christ marries 
        thousands.</i> It is a holy and chaste polygamy. Multitudes of people do 
        not defile this marriage bed. <i>Any poor sinner who brings a humble, 
        believing heart may be married to Christ. </p>
        </i>
        <p align="justify">(b) There is <u>a closer union</u> in this holy 
        marriage than there can be in any other. In other marriages, two make <i>
        one flesh</i>—but Christ and the believer make <i>one spirit</i>: &quot;But 
        he who is joined to the Lord is <i>one spirit</i> with Him.&quot; (ICor. 
        6:17). Now as the soul is more excellent than the body, and admits of 
        far greater joy, so <i>this spiritual union brings in more astonishing 
        delights and ravishments</i> than any other marriage relationship is 
        capable of. The joy that flows from the mystical union is unspeakable 
        and full of glory (I Peter 1:8). </p>
        <p align="justify">(c) <u>This union with Christ never ceases</u>. Other 
        marriages are soon at an end. <i>Death </i>cuts asunder the marriage 
        knot—but <i>this marital union is eternal</i>. You who are once Christ's 
        spouse shall never again be a widow: &quot;I will betroth you to me <i>
        forever</i>&quot; (Hosea 2:19). To speak properly, our marriage with Christ 
        begins where other marriages end, at death. </p>
        <b>
        <p align="justify">In this life there is only <i>the contract</i></b>. 
        The Jews had a time set between their engagement and marriage, sometimes 
        a year or more. In this life there is only the engagement and contract; 
        promises are made on both sides, and love passes secretly between Christ 
        and the soul. He gives some smiles of his face, and the soul sends up 
        her sighs and drops tears of love. But all this is only a <i>preliminary</i> 
        work, and something leading up to the marriage. The glorious completing 
        and solemnizing of the marriage is reserved for heaven. There, in 
        heaven, is the marriage supper of the Lamb (Rev. 19:9) and the bed of 
        glory perfumed with love where the souls of the elect shall be 
        perpetually consoling themselves. &quot;Then shall we ever be with the Lord&quot; 
        (I Thess. 4:17). So <i>death merely begins our marriage with Christ.</p>

        <p align="justify">Application 1: </b></font><font FACE="Verdana">If 
        Christ is the <i>head</i> of the mystical body (Eph. 1:22), then this 
        doctrine <u>beheads the Pope</u>, that man of sin who usurps this 
        prerogative of being the head of the church, and so would defile 
        Christ's marriage bed. What blasphemy this is! Two heads are monstrous. 
        Christ is Head, as he is Husband. There is no vice-husband, no deputy in 
        his place. The Pope is the beast in Revelation (Rev. 13:11). To make him

        there is such a marital union, let us <u>test whether we are united to 
        Christ</u>: </p>
        <p align="justify">1. Have we <b>chosen</b> Christ to set our love upon, 
        and is this choice founded on knowledge? </p>
        <p align="justify">2. Have we <b>consented</b> to the match? It is not 
        enough that Christ is willing to have us—but are we willing to have him? 
        God does not so force salvation upon us that we shall have Christ 
        whether we want to or not. We must consent to have him. Many approve of 
        Christ—but do not give their consent. And this consent must be: </p>
        <p align="justify">(a) <u>Pure and genuine</u>. We consent to have him 
        for his own worth and excellence: &quot;You are fairer than the sons of men&quot; 
        (Psalm. 45:2). </p>
        <p align="justify">(b) A <u>present</u> consent: &quot;now is the acceptable 
        time&quot; (2 Cor. 6:2). If we put Christ off with delays and excuses, 
        perhaps he will stop coming. He will leave off wooing. &quot;His spirit shall 
        no longer strive,&quot; and then, poor sinner, what will you do? When God's 
        wooing ends, your woes begin. </p>
        <p align="justify">3. Have we <b>taken</b> Christ? <i>Faith is the bond 
        of the union</i>. Christ is joined to us by his Spirit, and we are 
        joined to him by faith. Faith ties the marriage knot. </p>
        <p align="justify">4. Have we <b>given ourselves</b> up to Christ? Thus 
        the spouse in the text says, &quot;I am his,&quot; as if she had said, &quot;All I have 
        is for the use and service of Christ.&quot; <i>Have we made a surrender? </i>
        Have we given up our name and will to Christ? When the devil solicits by 
        a temptation, do we say, &quot;We are not our own, we are Christ's; our 
        tongues are his, we must not defile them with oaths; our bodies are his 
        temple, we must not pollute them with sin?&quot; If it is so, it is a sign 
        that the Holy Spirit has produced this blessed union between Christ and 
        us. </p>

        are joined in marriage with Christ! There is not only assimilation but 
        union; they are not only <i>like</i> Christ but <i>one</i> with Christ. 
        All the saints have this honor. When a king marries a beggar, by virtue 
        of the union she is ennobled and made of the blood royal. As wicked men 
        are united to the prince of darkness, and he settles hell upon them as 
        their inheritance, so the godly are divinely united to Christ, who is 
        King of kings, and Lord of Lords (Rev. 19:16). By virtue of this sacred 
        union the saints are <i>dignified above the angels</i>. Christ is the 
        Lord of the angels—but not their husband. </p>

        They are united to Christ, who is <b>the best Husband</b>, &quot;the Chief 
        among ten thousand&quot; (Song 5:10). Christ is a Husband who cannot be 
        paralleled: </p>
        <p align="justify">(a) <u>For tender care</u>. The spouse cannot be as 
        considerate of her own soul and credit as Christ is considerate of her: 
        &quot;He cares for you&quot; (I Pet. 5:7). Christ has a debate with himself, 
        consulting and projecting how to carry on the work of our salvation. He 
        transacts all our affairs, he attends to our business as his own. 
        Indeed, he himself is concerned in it. He brings fresh supplies to his 
        spouse. If she <i>wanders</i> out of the way, he guides her. If she <i>
        stumbles</i>, he holds her by the hand. If she <i>falls</i>, he raises 
        her. If she is <i>dull</i>, he quickens her by his Spirit. If she is <i>
        perverse</i>, he draws her with cords of love. If she is <i>sad</i>, he 
        comforts her with promises. </p>
        <p align="justify">(b) <u>For ardent affection</u>. No husband loves 
        like Christ. The Lord says to the people, &quot;I have loved you,&quot; and they 
        say, &quot;In what way have you loved us?&quot; (Mal. 1:2). But we cannot say to 
        Christ, &quot;In what way have you loved us?&quot; Christ has given <i>real 
        demonstrations of his love</i> to his spouse. He has sent her his <i>
        Word</i>, which is a love-letter, and he has given her his <i>Spirit</i>, 
        which is a love-token. Christ loves more than any other husband: </p>
        <p align="justify"><u>Christ puts a richer robe on his bride</u>: &quot;For 
        He has clothed me with the <i>garments of salvation</i>, He has covered 
        me with the <i>robe of righteousness</i>, as a bridegroom decks himself 
        with ornaments, and as a bride adorns herself with her jewels.&quot; (Isa. 
        61:10).</p>
        <p align="justify"><i>In this robe, God looks on us as if we had not 
        sinned!</i> This robe is as truly ours to justify us, as it is Christ's 
        to bestow on us. This robe not only <i>covers</i> but <i>adorns</i>. 
        Having on this robe, we are reputed righteous, not only as righteous as 
        angels—but <i>as righteous as Christ</i>: &quot;that we might be made the 
        righteousness of God in him&quot; (2 Cor.5:21). </p>
        <p align="justify"><u>Christ gives his bride not only his golden 
        garments but his image!</u> <i>He loves her into his own likeness.</i> A 
        husband may have a dear affection for his wife—but he cannot stamp his 
        own image on her. If she is deformed, he may give her a veil to hide 
        it—but he cannot put his beauty on her. But Christ imparts &quot;the beauty 
        of holiness&quot; to his spouse: &quot;Your fame went out among the nations 
        because of your <i>beauty</i>, for it was <i>perfect</i> through My 
        splendor which I had bestowed on you,&quot; (Ezek. 16:14). When Christ 
        marries a soul, he makes it lovely: &quot;You are <i>all beautiful</i>, my 
        love&quot; (Song 4:7). <i>Christ never thinks he has loved his spouse enough 
        until he can see his own face in her. </p>
        </i>
        <p align="justify"><u>Christ discharges those debts</u> which no other 
        husband can. Our sins are the worst debts we owe. If all the angels 
        should contribute money, they could not pay one of these debts—but 
        Christ frees us from these. He is both a Husband and a Surety. He says 
        to justice what Paul said concerning Onesimus, &quot;But if he has wronged 
        you or owes anything, put that on my account.&quot; (Philem. 1:18). </p>
        <p align="justify"><u>Christ has suffered more for his spouse</u> than 
        ever any husband did for a wife. He suffered <i>poverty</i> and <i>
        ignominy</i>. He who crowned the heavens with stars was himself crowned 
        with thorns. He was called a companion of sinners, so that we might be 
        made companions of angels. He had no regard of his life; <i>he leaped 
        into the sea of his Father's wrath to save his spouse from drowning!</i>
        </p>
        <p align="justify"><u>Christ's love does not end with his life</u>. He 
        loves his spouse <i>forever</i>: &quot;I will betroth you to me <i>forever</i>&quot; 
        (Hos. 2:19). Well may the apostle call it &quot;a love which passes 
        knowledge&quot; (Eph. 3:19). </p>
        <b>
        <p align="justify">3. See how RICH believers are.</b> They have married 
        into the crown of heaven, and by virtue of the marital union <i>all 
        Christ's riches go to believers</i>: &quot;communion is founded in union.&quot; 
        Christ communicates his graces (John 1:16). As long as Christ has them, 
        believers shall not be in need. And he communicates his 
        privileges—justification, glorification. <i>He settles a kingdom on his 
        spouse as her inheritance</i> (Heb. 12:28). This is a key to the 
        apostle's riddle, &quot;as having nothing, and yet <i>possessing all things</i>&quot; 
        (2 Cor. 6:10). By virtue of the marriage union, <i>the saints have an 
        interest in all Christ's riches!</i> </p>
        <b>
        <p align="justify">4. See how fearful a sin it is, to abuse the saints.</b> 
        It is an injury done to Christ, for believers are mystically one with 
        him: &quot;Saul, Saul, why do you persecute <i>me?&quot;</i> (Acts 9:4). When the 
        body was wounded, the Head, being in heaven, cried out. In this sense, 
        men crucify Christ afresh (Heb. 6:6), because what is done to his 
        members is done to him. If Gideon was avenged upon those who slew his 
        brethren, will not Christ much more be avenged on those that wrong his 
        spouse (Judges 8:21)? Will a king tolerate having his treasure rifled, 
        his crown thrown in the dust, his queen beheaded? Will Christ bear with 
        the affronts and injuries done to his bride? The saints are the apple of 
        Christ's eye (Zech. 2:8), and let those who strike at his eye answer for 
        it. Isa 49:26 &quot;I will feed those who oppress you with their own flesh, 
        and they shall be drunk with their own blood as with sweet wine&quot; 
        (Isa.49:26). </p>
        <b>
        <p align="justify">5. See the reason why the saints so rejoice in the 
        Word and sacrament,</b> because here they meet with their Husband, 
        Christ! The wife desires to be in the presence of her husband. The <i>
        ordinances</i> are the chariot in which Christ rides, <i>the lattice 
        through which he looks forth and shows his smiling face. Here Christ 
        displays the banner of love</i> (Song 2:4). The Lord's Supper is nothing 
        other than a pledge and security of that eternal communion which the 
        saints shall have with Christ in heaven. <i>Then he will take the spouse 
        into his bosom.</i> If Christ is so sweet in an ordinance, when we have 
        only <i>short glances</i> and <i>dark glimpses </i>of him by faith, oh 
        then, <i>how delightful and ravishing will his presence be in heaven 
        when we see him face to face and are forever in his loving embraces! </p>

        <p align="justify">Application 4:</b></font><font FACE="Verdana"> <b>
        This mystical union affords much comfort to believers</b> in several 
        cases: </p>
        <p align="justify">1. <u>In the case of the disrespect and unkindness of 
        the world</u>: &quot;in wrath they hate me&quot; (Psalm. 55:3). But <i>though we 
        live in an unkind world, we have a kind Husband:</i> &quot;As the Father has 
        loved me, so have I loved you&quot; (John 15:9). What angel can tell how God 
        the Father loves Christ? Yet the<i> Father's love to Christ is made the 
        copy and pattern of Christ's love to his spouse! </i>This love of Christ 
        as far exceeds all created love as the sun outshines the light of a 
        torch. And is not this a matter of comfort? Though the world hates me, 
        Christ still loves me. </p>
        <p align="justify">2. <u>In the case of weakness of grace</u>. The 
        believer cannot lay hold on Christ, except with <i>a trembling hand</i>. 
        There is a &quot;spirit of infirmity&quot; on him. But oh, weak Christian, here is 
        strong consolation: you have a marital union to Christ! You are the 
        spouse of Christ! Will he will bear with you as the weaker vessel? Will 
        a husband divorce his wife because she is weak and sickly? No! he will 
        be the more tender with her. Christ <i>hates </i>divorce—but he will <i>
        pity </i>infirmity. When the spouse is faint and ready to be 
        discouraged, Christ puts his left hand under her head (Song 2:6). This 
        is the spouse's comfort when she is weak. Her Husband can infuse 
        strength into her: &quot;My God shall be my strength&quot; (Isa. 49:5).</p>
        <p align="justify">3. <u>In the case of death</u>. When believers 
        die—they go to their Husband! Who would not be willing to cross the gulf 
        of death that they might meet with their Husband, Christ? &quot;I desire to 
        loosen anchor&quot; (Phil. 1:23), and be with Christ. What though the way is 
        dirty? We are going to our friend. When a woman is engaged, she longs 
        for the day of marriage<i>. After the saints' funeral, their marriage 
        begins. </i>The <i>body</i> is a <i>prison</i> to the soul. Who would 
        not desire to exchange a prison for a marriage bed? How glad Joseph was 
        to go out of prison to the king's court! God is wise; <i>he lets us meet 
        with changes and troubles here, so that he may wean us from the world 
        and make us long for death.</i> When the soul is divorced from the body, 
        it is married to Christ. </p>
        <p align="justify">4. <u>In the case of passing sentence at the day of 
        judgment</u>. There is a marriage union and, oh Christian, <i>your 
        Husband shall be your judge!</i> A wife would not fear appearing at the 
        bar if her husband was sitting as judge. What though the devil should 
        bring in many indictments against you? <i>Christ will expunge your sins 
        in his blood.</i> Could he possibly say, &quot;I shall condemn my spouse?&quot; 
        Oh, what a comfort this is!<i> The Husband is judge!</i> Christ cannot 
        pass sentence against his spouse without passing it against himself. For 
        Christ and believers are one. </p>
        <p align="justify">5. <u>In the case of the saints' suffering</u>. The 
        church of God is exposed in this life to many injuries—but she has a 
        Husband in heaven who is mindful of her and will &quot;turn water into wine&quot; 
        for her. Now it is a time of mourning with the spouse because the 
        Bridegroom is absent (Matt. 9:15). But shortly she shall put off her 
        mourning. Christ will wipe the tears of blood off the cheeks of his 
        spouse: &quot;He will swallow up death forever, and the Lord God will wipe 
        away tears from all faces&quot; (Isa. 25:8). Christ will comfort his spouse 
        for as much time as she has been afflicted. He will solace her with his 
        love; he will take away the cup of trembling and give her the cup of 
        consolation. And now she shall forget all her sorrows, being called into 
        the banqueting house of heaven and having the banner of Christ's love 
        displayed over her. </p>
        <b>
        <p align="justify">Application 5: Let me press several duties </b>upon 
        those who have this marriage union with Christ: </p>
        <p align="justify">1. <u>Make use of this relationship</u> in two cases:
        </p>
        <p align="justify">(a) <u>When the law brings in its indictments against 
        you</u>. The law says, &quot;Here there are so many debts to be paid!&quot; and it 
        demands satisfaction. Acknowledge the debt—but turn it all over to your 
        Husband, Christ. It is a maxim in law that the suit must not go against 
        the wife, as long as the husband is living. Tell Satan when he accuses 
        you, &quot;It is true that the debt is mine—but go to my Husband, Christ! He 
        will discharge it.&quot; If we took this course, we might relieve ourselves 
        of much trouble. By faith we turn over the debt to our Husband. 
        Believers are not in a state of widowhood but of marriage. Satan will 
        never go to Christ—he knows that justice is satisfied and the debt book 
        cancelled—but he comes to us for the debt so that he may perplex us. We 
        should send him to Christ and then all lawsuits would cease. This is a 
        believer's triumph. <i>When he is guilty in himself, he is worthy in 
        Christ. When he is spotted in himself, he is pure in his Head. </p>
        </i>
        <p align="justify">(b) <u>In the case of desertion</u>. Christ may (for 
        reasons best known to himself) step aside for a time: &quot;my beloved had 
        withdrawn himself&quot; (Song 5:6). Do not say, therefore, that Christ has 
        gone for good. It is a fruit of jealousy in a wife, when her husband has 
        left her a while, to think that he has gone from her for good. Every 
        time Christ removes himself out of sight, it is wrong for us to say, 
        &quot;The Lord has forsaken me&quot; (Isa. 49:14). This is jealousy, and it is a 
        wrong done to the love of Christ and the sweetness of this marriage 
        relationship. Christ may forsake his spouse in regards to <i>comfort</i>—but 
        he will not forsake her in regard of <i>union</i>. A husband may be a 
        thousand miles distant from his wife—but he is still a husband. Christ 
        may leave his spouse—but the marriage knot still holds. </p>
        <p align="justify">2. <u>Rejoice in your Husband, Christ</u>. Has Christ 
        honored you by taking you into the marriage relationship and making you 
        one with himself? This calls for joy. By virtue of the union, believers 
        are sharers with Christ in his riches. It was a custom among the Romans, 
        when the wife was brought home, for her to receive the keys of her 
        husband's house, intimating that the treasure and custody of the house 
        was now committed to her. When Christ brings his bride home to those 
        glorious mansions which he has gone ahead to prepare for her (John 
        14:2), <i>he will hand over the keys of his treasure to her, and she 
        shall be as rich as heaven can make her! </i>And shall not the spouse 
        rejoice and sing aloud upon her bed (Psalm. 149:5)? Christians, let the 
        times be ever so sad, you may rejoice in your spiritual espousals (Hab. 
        3:17,18). Let me tell you, it is a sin not to rejoice—you find fault 
        with your Husband, Christ. </p>
        <p align="justify">When a wife is always sighing and weeping, what will 
        others say? &quot;This woman has a bad husband!&quot; Is this the fruit of 
        Christ's love to you, to reflect dishonor upon him? <i>A melancholy 
        spouse saddens Christ's heart.</i> I do not deny that Christians should 
        grieve for sins of daily occurrence—but to be always weeping (as if they 
        mourned without hope) is dishonorable to the marriage relationship. 
        &quot;Rejoice in the Lord always&quot; (Phil. 4:4). Rejoicing brings credit to 
        your husband. Christ loves a cheerful bride, and indeed the very purpose 
        of God's making us sad is to make us rejoice. We sow in tears, so that 
        we may reap in joy. The excessive sadness and contrition of the godly 
        will make others afraid to embrace Christ. They will begin to question 
        whether there is that satisfactory joy in religion which is claimed. Oh, 
        you saints of God, do not forget consolation; let others see that you do 
        not regret your choice. It is joy that puts liveliness and activity into 
        a Christian: &quot;the joy of the Lord is your strength&quot; (Neh. 8:10). <i>The 
        soul is swiftest in duty when it is carried on the wings of joy. </p>
        </i>
        <p align="justify">3. <u>Adorn this marriage relationship</u>, so that 
        you may be a crown to your husband. </p>
        <p align="justify">(a) <u>Wear a veil</u>. We read of the spouse's veil 
        (Song 5:7). <i>This veil is <b>humility</b>. </p>
        </i>
        <p align="justify">(b) <u>Put on your jewels</u>. These are the <b>
        graces</b> which for their luster are compared to rows of pearl and 
        chains of gold (Song 1:1O). These precious jewels distinguish Christ's 
        bride from strangers. </p>
        <p align="justify">(c) <u>Behave as becomes Christ's spouse</u>: </p>
        <p align="justify"><b>In chastity</b>. Be chaste in your judgments; do 
        not defile yourselves with error. Error adulterates the mind (1 Tim. 
        6:5). It is one of Satan's artifices—first to defile the judgment, then 
        the conscience. </p>
        <p align="justify"><b>In sanctity</b>. It is not for Christ's spouse to 
        behave like harlots. A half-naked breast and a wanton tongue—do not 
        befit a saint. Christ's bride must shine forth in gospel purity, so that 
        she may make her husband fall in love with her. A woman was asked what 
        dowry she brought her husband. She answered that she had no dowry—but 
        she promised to keep herself chaste. So though we can bring Christ no 
        dowry, yet he expects us to keep ourselves pure, not spotting the 
        breasts of our virginity by contagious and scandalous sins. </p>
        <p align="justify">4. <u>Love your Husband, Christ</u> (Song 2:5). Love 
        him though he is reproached and persecuted. A wife loves her husband 
        when in prison. To inflame your love towards Christ, consider: </p>
        <p align="justify">(a) <u>Nothing else is fit for you to love</u>. If 
        Christ is your Husband, it is not fit to have other lovers who would 
        make Christ grow jealous. </p>
        <p align="justify">(b) <u>He is worthy of your love</u>. He is of 
        unparalleled beauty: &quot;altogether lovely&quot; (Song 5:16).</p>
        <p align="justify"></p>
        <p align="justify">(c) <u>How fervent is Christ's love towards you!</u> 
        He loves you in your worst condition, he loves you in affliction. The 
        goldsmith loves his gold in the <i>furnace</i>. Just so, Christ loves 
        you notwithstanding your fears and blemishes. The <i>saints' infirmities
        </i>cannot wholly remove Christ's love from them (Jer. 3:1). Oh then, 
        how the spouse should be endeared in her love to Christ! Perfect love to 
        Christ, will be the excellence of heaven. Our love will then be like the 
        sun in its full strength!</p>
